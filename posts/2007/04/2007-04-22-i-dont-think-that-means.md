In the department of "I don't think that means what you think it means"...

Someone in a writing/feedback comm on LJ just compared one of my poems to Nickelback. Which is... well, I don't dislike Nickelback, per se, I just find them a little pedestrian. And I can tell from the context that the person thought it was a compliment, but, well, geez.

... _Nickelback_.

Yeah, I think it's time for me to have some quality time away from LiveJournal now.
