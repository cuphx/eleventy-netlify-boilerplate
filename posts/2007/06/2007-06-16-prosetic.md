Totally made up words for the win. I went ahead and added some of the articles and fiction back in. I guess it makes me feel more useful or something. Really, the reason I'm doing it is because I feel a bit down on my poetry still. Maybe I should try writing longer poems. The few long pieces I've written are ones I really like (one is the poem that I mentioned earlier being my first accepted for print, and no, that's not actually up on the site) so it seems to be a format that suits me... whenever inspiration happens by. Which isn't often enough.

Via the Poetrics list I came across [MiPOesias](http://www.mipoesias.com/), a rather clever poetry magazine, so that can be my link for the day.
