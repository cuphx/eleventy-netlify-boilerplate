Recently I had the pleasure of attending a convention at which one of the guests of honor was author [Michael Stackpole](http://stormwolf.com/). I got to chat with him a bit and also attended several of his panels. One of the panels was called "21 Days to a Novel" and is basically a very simple way to work out characters, relationships, setting and plot for a novel. Being the busy little beaver of geekiness that I am, I took some pretty decent notes, and starting Monday I'll be doing each of the 21 days here on my blog for all of you, my loyal readers, to laugh at. Enjoy.
