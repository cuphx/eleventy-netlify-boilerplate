So here's the thing.

I need feedback on my poetry, or else I can't seem to get motivated to type and clean up stuff once I spew it out in my notebook. Hence, blog.

However, I've been thinking about actually sending stuff somewhere for publication, and generally that requires that you let them be the first to print something. Alas, blog.

So I need to find a way to get feedback on my poetry without posting it out in the middle of my blog, apparently.

I sent in an application to Fertile Ground, but haven't heard anything since, so I was thinking about seeing if any of you guys would be interested in reading locked posts with poetry I'm trying to workshop in them, if I gave you the password, or if maybe a couple people who aren't already in a group wanted to make one, or if anybody could recommend another crit group that's currently open to new members?

Thanks
