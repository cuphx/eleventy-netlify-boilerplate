No poem this week. I'm hoping I'll get it together enough to have one next week; we'll see.

Gearing up to work on a couple of fiction projects for either/both [70 Days of Sweat](http://www.70daysofsweat.com/wordpress/) or/and [Novel in 90](http://community.livejournal.com/novel_in_90/). This is of course on top of the 2YN project at [Future Motion](http://fmwriters.com/) and, you know, work and going back to school.

Meanwhile, I'm getting a few other things out of my head when I can.

Hopefully I'll have something to share soon.
