[January](http://poetmom.blogspot.com/) created a [meme](http://poetmom.blogspot.com/2008/05/napowrimo-meme.html) for NaPoWriMo participants, so I figured I'd fill it out.

Number of poems written in April: 32, counting off-site Number of poems you’ll keep and revise: I don't generally revise or develop my haiku, so probably about five. List the titles of your top three NaPoWriMo poems: [Dust on Dreams](http://m0nkeyboy.wordpress.com/2008/04/22/dust-on-dreams/), [Crazy Quilt](http://m0nkeyboy.wordpress.com/2008/04/06/crazy-quilt/), [Out of the Loop](http://m0nkeyboy.wordpress.com/2008/04/09/out-of-the-loop/) List your three least favorite NaPoWriMo poems: Pissing Contest, Just Another White Boy, Cheer Up Emo Kid Favorite line from one of your NaPoWriMo poems: "the canvas/is purple and blue, hope and/the sky" Favorite poem by a NaPoWriMo participant: [Intoxication](http://poetmom.blogspot.com/2008/04/napowrimo-22.html) What surprised you most about writing a poem a day? How hard it is for me to post something I'm not satisfied with. Now that you’ve started the momentum, what’s next? Stopping. I mean, something else. Fiction, probably.

Overall, it was an interesting exercise and I'm glad I did it, but I'm not sure if I'll do it next year. I got some good haiku out of it, and I actually also got a couple of half-finished pieces I didn't want to put up yet.
