It's been a while since I kept up proper blogging habits. It's been a while since I had a site where I posted my writing, for that matter. It's not doing anyone any good on my hard drive.

I spent virtually the entire day getting stuff formatted properly and finding a theme I liked. I definitely do not have the time to worry about making my own layout, that's just ridiculous. There are enough good themes out there that I'm happy to let someone else do the hard part.

I've still got more stuff to add - the Forgotten City stories, possibly artwork or photography, and I might put up some of my more recent, not-embarassing fanfic. We'll see. The important part is the stories. Always has been for me, and always will be.
