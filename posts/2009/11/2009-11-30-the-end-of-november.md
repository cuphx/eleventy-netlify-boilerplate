I hit the word count required to win NaNoWriMo somewhere around two o'clock Saturday afternoon. That wasn't good enough for me this year, though - it was finish the story or bust, this time. I'm tired of never finishing anything.

So yes, at 53,349 words, the first draft of Starlings is done. The title's probably going to change, since one of my first revisions is going to be a name swap.

Now that November is over, I need to refocus. There were a lot of things I _didn't_ work on during November because of Nano - a fiction piece for Yuletide, Sic Transit Fidei edits, and so on. I'm going to be going back to priority juggling and maybe see if I cant use NaNoFiMo - National Novel Finishing Month - to wrap up Sic Transit Fidei so you guys get weekly updates without interruption.
