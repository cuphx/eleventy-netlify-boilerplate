Well, I didn't quite make my 10k goal.

Counting the writing I had to do for my classes, the finale of Sic Transit Fidei, and the first Forgotten City omake, I ended the month with 9605. If I'd been sensible and done this summary yesterday I probably could have cranked out that last 400, but to be honest, I let myself finish a homework assignment today and still counted it for January since I did the majority of it then, so I'm going to call it a wash and make it up in February.

10,395 words in February, here I come!
