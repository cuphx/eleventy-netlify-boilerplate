Since I signed up for the Creative Every Day challenge this year, I'm going to try to do weekly reviews that keep me on track. Since this is my writing blog, only my writing will be posted here - other things, when I get to them, will be linked.

All I really have to report so far is writing: I had a good, solid start to my writing in the new year. I'm almost halfway to a phoenix badge on 750words, and I posted two character journals and a new short story this week, as well as a piece I originally wrote for the Yuletide small-fandom fiction exchange.

I need to get moving on a poetry-inspired story that I'd like to finish by the end of the month, and start revisions on _Vampire Finch_ so we'll see how that goes.
