I broke fifty days on my 750words streak last week and I'm in the process of setting a new personal best on the site. I'm pleased with that.

Not a lot to link to, writing-wise, but I have been working on a couple of things that haven't seen the light of day yet, including the second draft of Vampire Finch in the Wild. Not a lot of progress on it so far but I'm hoping to have something to show off soon.

I did a little bit of art this week, sketching at work and making those little avatar dolls. I'm not entirely sure avatar dolls count as "art" but I do think they count as creativity at the least.

Due to other obligations, I don't know how much I'll have to show for the upcoming week, but I'll take it a day at a time and we'll see what happens.
