Several people asked to see the hook I made in my blacksmithing class.

I don't think it's much, Â but who am I to argue?

So here it is.

The rust formed almost immediately when I quenched it at the end of class. Most of my classmates' hooks had it on there too. I think it looks kind of charming but, well, I'm biased.

The leaf, of course, has no texture. I managed to end up with the textured side to the back because I am _awesome_.

My curlie-cue on the hook is fucking _perfect_, though.
