With the end of February, I finished my first official One Month Challenge. I've written for entire months before but I was hesitant to sign up for the Challenge because I didn't want to "fail." But at the end of January I already had a goal that I didn't want to fail at: I wanted the phoenix badge, and I wanted it very badly.

If I messed up somehow and had to start over, failing the challenge too wouldn't be that big of a deal. So I went ahead and signed up, and then I kept on writing every day. At the end of the month, I won the challenge. And today I got my phoenix badge!

Somehow when I wasn't paying attention, I passed 200,000 words written on 750words as well. I don't get the double-flock badge until I hit 250,000, but dang. I'm pretty satisfied nonetheless.
