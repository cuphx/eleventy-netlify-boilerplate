It looks quiet around here, doesn't it?

Don't worry, I am plugging away behind the scenes, working on things that don't quite come to fruition. I signed up for a few original fiction projects that require works over 10k, so those will be in progress in the background - they'll be on the sidebar as soon as I decide which ones I'm working on.

According to [750 Words](http://750words.com/), I wrote more than 27k this month. I'm think I'll get my 250k badge next month. I haven't lost my streak, so I'm sitting around 125 days. I don't think I'm particularly interested in achieving pterodactyl, but I can't bring myself to intentionally end the streak, so I might as well enjoy phoenix while it lasts.

I spent the last two days cleaning and formatting a few things to upload at Smashwords. You can find them [here](https://www.smashwords.com/profile/view/finch) if you're interested - the In Medias Res books and one of my Epsilon stories.

National Poetry Writing Month starts tomorrow as well, and yes, I will be posting my poems here, hopefully one a day for the full thirty days.
