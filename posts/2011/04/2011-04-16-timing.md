I've been letting my schedule get the better of me. In addition to the half-time class schedule I'm taking, which I talk about here, I have a full time job. Over on my [writing blog](http://jackadreams.info/), I'm posting a poem every day for National Poetry Month. I'm working on fiction projects.

None of these should be excuses, though.

My creative time is what I make of it, no more and no less. It's not unlike making time for the spiritual in that respect - and it's just as easy to let it slip away.

I know authors who write thousands of words a day and seem utterly unfazed by this. I'm not that prolific, no, but it's something I can aspire to. I can make time for what matters, even if it's not as much as I'd like. And the more time I make now, the easier it'll be to make even more later.
