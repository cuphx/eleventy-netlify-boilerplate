So this post-a-day thing... well, it worked out all right for the poetry, didn't it?

And I just heard about [Story-A-Day](http://storyaday.org/) and signed up for the notice list. A story a day? Doesn't that sound like overdoing it?

Well, there's no length requirement, so as long as it's a complete story, I can write twitter-fic, drabbles, flash fiction... whatever suits my fancy and my attention span.

I guess we'll see how it goes. Worst case scenario is that I crash and burn, right?
