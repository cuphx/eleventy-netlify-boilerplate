We succeeded in sorting the Christmas boxes tonight.

We had three boxes of Christmas stuff. Small boxes - each about the size of a banker's box - but still, three. Included in those three boxes were _three_ Christmas trees. And I'm not even that into Christmas.

My girlfriend had a series of ornaments from her childhood (some of which never made it out of her ex's place, apparently) and I had my collection of angel figures. We both ended up letting go of some ornaments.

We also seem to have acquired a collection of wrapping paper and ribbon. All of that went.

And I got rid of all three trees. Portland has lots of trees. I don't need to move mine.
