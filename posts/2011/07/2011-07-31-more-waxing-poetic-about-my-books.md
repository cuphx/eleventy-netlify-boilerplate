[![](http://coloredtabs.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/shelves-004.jpg?w=300 "My books")](http://coloredtabs.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/shelves-004.jpg)I'm down to 49 books, guys. I counted.

I don't usually ascribe to the "count all the things" school of minimalism, but in this particular case, I was curious. Considering that as far back as I can remember, I've had more books than I've had shelves.

Of course, we're making progress selling all our shelves too so I guess I might still end up with more books than shelves. Two jewelry storage units went out yesterday thanks to Craigslist, and I'm waiting to hear from one of my coworkers about whether she wants to arrange the sale of two bookshelves and a desk today.

I'm just starting into the throws of "no, really, do I want to keep this?" now, as we hit the one-month deadline. Right now, everything needs to justify itself, and I need to keep reminding myself that everything needs to answer that question instead of packing things without thinking about it.

Our notice is officially given to the apartment complex, so we're moving at the end of August no matter what!
