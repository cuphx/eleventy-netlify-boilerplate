Huh, it's been almost two weeks.

I've done a couple of things - I put my two weeks notice in at my job. I bought a storage bag for the top of the car.

The reason for the storage bag is that my girlfriend and I decided we're getting rid of almost everything, not renting a truck, not renting a trailer, nothing. We're going to ship four boxes media mail, and everything else has to fit in the hatchback.

My boss has decided that I should spend my last two weeks working overtime, so my girlfriend is in charge of getting rid of everything else in the house. She updates me during the day when I'm at work and every night I come home to a slightly more empty apartment.
