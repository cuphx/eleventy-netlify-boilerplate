I think it went well - asking Odin for chattiness definitely seems to have helped. The more I see of it, the more I think this job would be a good fit for me, at least for the time being. It would give me a place to settle for a while and decide what I do really want and how I want to get there. Hopefully I'll hear back about the second interview and we'll go from there.

Then on my way in to my current job, I stopped at the library and picked up a couple of books on finding a career you enjoy. When I don't know where to start with something, I go to the library. It's a thing. And I never really thought of the What Color Is Your Parachute genre as the kind of thing I would need, but maybe it is. I don't think it can hurt, anyway. I have to do _something_. My other option is to make a list of all the things I've thought I wanted to be when I grew up and see which of them still appeals to me.

I guess I should also be looking at possible magical solutions to the problem: I could ask Ganesh for help figuring out what direction I should be going in. I also think I put too many limitations on myself - I've given up on a lot of things as "not realistic for making a living" like writing, sculpture, that kind of thing. But just because it's _hard_ to make a living at those things doesn't mean I shouldn't try to do it. It can still be worth pursuing. And it's more common than ever for people to "make a living" from a variety of smaller freelance kinds of work rather than a single 9-5 job.

It can be done. I just need to figure out what _it_ is.
