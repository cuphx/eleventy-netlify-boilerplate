Two more interviews down now. I almost hate to admit it but this is getting exhausting. I feel like I can only gear up and come back down so many times. It should be almost over now, however. I can't imagine there's anyone left that I haven't spoken to.

I'm trying not to overanalyze, though I did get several positive kinds of magical thinking feedback - songs I consider good luck or lucky numbers, that kind of thing. As magical thinking goes, I consider this variety fairly harmless. Maybe the gods love me and want me to be happy. Worst case scenario is coincidence.

(One day you will probably get to hear my rant about the idea that there's no such thing as coincidence.)

This week's challenge for New Year, New You is to kick back and take care of yourself. This... is not easy for me, but judging by the posts I've already seen on my reading list, I don't think it's easy for anyone doing the challenge. (Well played, Deb.) I don't think it's possible to have any more interviews for this job. Either I'll get it or I won't. Nothing I can do now but pray, enchant, and let it happen.
