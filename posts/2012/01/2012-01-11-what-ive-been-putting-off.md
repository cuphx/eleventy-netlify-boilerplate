Posting, for one thing. So it's been a couple of days. I'm amazed I kept the daily (or almost-daily) posting up as long as I did, and I guess skipping two isn't really that bad. I had a good excuse yesterday.

Yesterday I learned that there's a bridge in Portland that's colloquially referred to as "Suicide Bridge." My train had to make an unscheduled stop just before the bridge and I was left to wait for a bit before service could continue. I don't want to go into detail here but suffice to say it left me so rattled that I barely had the mental fortitude to answer my phone when it rang.

The call, by the way, was that they want me to go in tomorrow, and contingent on a few other things, I should have the job. Conveniently, in [this week's New Year, New You challenge](http://dropoutdilettante.blogspot.com/2012/01/new-year-new-you-some-enchanted-evening.html), Deb pushes us to take care of something we've been meaning to do and haven't yet. Assuming everything works out, with the job taken care of, I should actually be able to reclaim some of my spare brain cycles from Lizard Brain and work on my other goals. (Lizard Brain spent most of yesterday night trying to figure out some way to start working my new, better job without actually quitting my old one which is on the other side of town and has a totally incompatible schedule. Look, I told myself, sometimes you have to take a risk. In this case, that "risk" is the rather ridiculous "quitting one job when you've been offered a new one." Lizard Brain needs to fuck off.)

Between that and the aforementioned incident with the bridge triggering my suicidal ideation, this week's really giving the my mental health work a run for the money. I've had to put a lot of effort into it, though, so I'm definitely notÂ  neglecting it. May want to reassess whether I could be asking for more metaphysical help here.

Health and creativity are really the goals I've been putting off, health most of all, but a normal work schedule should make getting some exercise in a lot more reasonable. I made the effort to spend some serious walking time in downtown Portland today, visiting the PSU campus, Powell's, and most of what lies in between. As for creativity, I have been doing bits and pieces but not really applying myself to it. Tomorrow I shall apply myself to my fiction after I leave my new job!
