I'm settling in to a work routine, and that's both good and bad. Good because routine is like a warm sunny rock for Lizard Brain to curl up and sleep on; bad because it's easy to lose track of things that are not work. Like writing. And, oh, all the other things on my goal list.

Oops.

This week's New Year, New You prompt is going to require going on a field trip, so it's going to have to wait for this weekend. Meanwhile I'm just... getting settled, I guess. But hopefully not settling. I don't want to settle. Just... to rest, a bit.
