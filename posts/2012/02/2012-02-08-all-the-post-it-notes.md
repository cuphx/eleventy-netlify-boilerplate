I've been in my new job about five weeks now. It may be my favorite workplace out of any I've been in so far. All the office supplies I could want are made available without any need for me to cajole or hunt down.

Now that I've gotten comfortable with the work itself, I'm starting to attack my file system. A certain amount of it is mandatory - a tickler file for appointments, for example - but for the most part, I'm left to my own devices. So far, I'm spending a lot of time re-sorting the other files in my drawer, labelling and re-labelling as I decide what I need.

I happened to come in at a very busy time, so I didn't get the opportunity to decide on "systems" for myself as I went. I'm paying for it now as I catch up, but in the long run I think it'll be good for me - it means I've had a chance to figure out how everything works and try several different things before settling into System 1.0. And of course there will always be System 2.0 when things inevitably change.

In the meantime, I have three different sizes of post-it notes in about eight different colors. And that makes up for a lot.
