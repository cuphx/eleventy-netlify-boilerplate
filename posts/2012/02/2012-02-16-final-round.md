Yes, it's the final round of the New Year, New You bl0g party! I'm very glad it existed, though, because I found a ton of really excellent blogs to read through it. The final prompt is to reflect on what I've learned in the last nine weeks.

The first thing is _holy shit once I started seriously applying myself I got what I wanted_. This shouldn't be a revelation to someone who's been doing the pagan/magician thing off and on for ten years. It is anyway. Sometimes you gotta learn something multiple times before it kicks in.

The second thing I learned is that I can, in fact, talk about things. The world doesn't end. They don't stop existing.

The third is that just talking helps, regardless of whether I have an audience. I get a lot of out just organizing my thoughts enough to put them down on metaphorical paper. I think this is another thing that I knew-but-didn't-know.

I learned that I need more specific goals, and that I tend to bite off more than I can chew - I made good progress on the ones that had specifics attached to them ("get a job I don't hate" "write every day" "do this spell and this other spell") and less progress on the nonspecific ones ("be healthier" is the one that really bombed, I think). The only exception to this is the neuroatypicality goal, which I am making great progress on without really understanding why.

So what's next? Well, another PBP post on Friday, a gauge check on Saturday, and my usual rambling about OCD, firebirds, and whatever else the rest of the week.

Oh, you mean my goals? I'm still deciding, but I'll keep you updated.
