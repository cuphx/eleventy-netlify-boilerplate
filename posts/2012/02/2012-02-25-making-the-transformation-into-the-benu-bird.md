**_\[THE CHAPTER OF\] MAKING THE TRANSFORMATION INTO THE BENU BIRD. The Osiris, the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, saith:-_**

I flew up out of primeval matter. I came into being like the god Khepera. I germinated like the plants. I am concealed like the tortoise \[in his shell\]. I am the seed of every god. I am Yesterday of the Four \[Quarters of the Earth, and\] the Seven Uraei, who came into being in the Eastern land. \[I am\] the Great One (Horus) who illumineth the Hememet spirits with the light of his body. \[I am\] that god in respect of Set. \[I am\] Thoth who \[stood\] between them (Horus and Set) as the judge on behalf of the Governor of Sekhem and the Souls of Anu. \[He was like\] a stream between them. I have come. I rise up on my throne. I am endowed with Khu. I am mighty. I am endowed with godhood among the gods. I am Khensu, \[the lord\] of every kind of strength.

_RUBRIC:_Â \[If\] this Chapter \[be known by the deceased\], he shall come forth pure by day after his death, and he shall perform every transformation which hs soul desireth to make. He shall be among the Followers of Un-Nefer, and he shall satisfy himself with the food of Osiris, and with sepulchral meals. He shall see the Disk \[of the Sun\], he shall be in good case upon earth before Ra, and his word shall be truth in the sight of Osiris, and no evil thing whatsoever shall have dominion over him for ever and ever.

_from the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Book Eight, Translated by E.A. Wallis Budge_
