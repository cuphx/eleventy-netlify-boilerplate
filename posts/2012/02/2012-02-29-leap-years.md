One of my aunts was born on February 29th, and there's a running joke in the family that she only has a birthday once every four years. It is, when you think about it, an unusual calendar designation. It's a day that only exists one year in four. I feel like there should be something "useful," in the working sense, about the 29th of February.

One could argue that the 29th is a day that doesn't exist, suggesting the day is somewhat more liminal than your average Thursday. Do you suppose it's got anything in common with those doors to Faerie that only open under certain conditions?

Not that I think the fae are big fans of leap years. Perhaps it'd be a good time for a working in honor of Tai Sui or another god of time or astrology?

Is anybody doing anything today?
