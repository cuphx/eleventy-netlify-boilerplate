The more attention I pay to the insects, to the thousand tiny lives around me each day,

the harder it seems to get. Ants appear out of cracks, grasshoppers fling themselves at my feet, even moths

land under my shoes. The more precious the life, the harder to avoid destroying it.

I need more eyes, more arms, fewer legs perhaps, or just your blessing and patience as I try again.
