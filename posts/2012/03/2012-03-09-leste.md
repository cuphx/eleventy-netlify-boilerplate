Winds, rise. May I have this dance? Join me in this waltz, courting prosperity, turning out bad luck. Let us spin around the floor Carry me where I need to be on wings of optimism, and please let it be where I want to be. I will tap out gracefully as you have finer partners but carry my words to any who will listen. Do not forget me.
