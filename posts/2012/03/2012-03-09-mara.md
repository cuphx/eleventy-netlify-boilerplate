your eyes are closed but your lips curl upwards your hands are open and water flows from your fingers

wash me clean, lady let me drink that which restores let me hold that which sparkles let me see that which is reflected

bless me as I sing your praise grant your waters to those who serve who light your candles and keep your altar and remember you
