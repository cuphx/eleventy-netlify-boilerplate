That's something I haven't really had a chance to do this week. Work was busy all week, and on Friday I got to meet New Boss... kind of, in passing, between all the other work I was doing.

Between deciding to join the ADF and a lot of personal discussion with [Amber](http://rippingback.wordpress.com) about how and where we want to go metaphysically and as a couple, it's been a kind of paradigm-shifting week. Plus I finally feel like I know where we're going with the apartment even if it's going to require work to get there. She's been crazy-productive this week too, moreso than me, and I'm a little jealous of how much she has to show for it.

Today I dragged her down to the Portland State University library. You have to pay for a non-student library card so I didn't get anything out, but I did take some notes from a hard-to-find book on Slavic mythology that they have. I went to [Powell's](http://www.powells.com/ "Powell's Books") too, and looked a several books but ended up not getting anything - I really, really suck at reading anything that's not on my ereader, guys, and I keep trying to remind myself of that. Ihave to read the more esoteric stuff on paper, I know, but almost nothing else gets read on paper.

My to-do list is just _ridiculous_ right now, but that's a good thing in my mind. It means I'm out of my slump even if I don't get all/most of it done!

I'm doing my best to cut down on soda at work, but it's hard to judge based on the first week of doing it if I'm succeeding. Ask me again next week. Also something happened at work that rattled me - someone I work with got fired. Nobody knows why and she didn't really get to say anything before they walked her out, I guess. It's super-awkward. I don't think my job's in any particular danger, but it still made Friday a lot less fun than it ought to be.

I've got the urge to write and I need to encourage it, but that'll probably go on my writing blog. Plus it's almost time for poetry!
