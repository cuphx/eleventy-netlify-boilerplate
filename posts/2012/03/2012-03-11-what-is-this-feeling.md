It's almost four a.m. I'm listening to Katy Perry.

Must be a plotbunny.

It is, actually. Not making enough progress to, you know, post anything yet. But I actually feel like writing, which is an improvement all by itself.

National Poetry Writing Month is coming up soon, and yes, I'll be doing it again this year. Prepare yourself for my lame haiku!

I think this blog needs a severe overhaul, but I'm not sure what kind of overhaul I actually want to give it. Sometimes I'm tempted to tear it down and start from scratch aside from some of the stories and poetry. I mean, geez, there's posts on here going back to 2005!

Not that I don't keep everything. I have things I wrote back in middle school, on the very first computer I got to keep in my room. They're on text files with names in all caps that are eight characters long because that was all we got back then. I wouldn't be getting rid of things permanently.

I'm not sure I'd want to get rid of much of the actual writing content on this site anyway. But the blog posts? I sincerely doubt anyone will miss it if my rambly posts from 2007 or whenever disappeared.

Right now I feel like this site is a bit of a mess, and I'm in a spring cleaning mood. All the messes in my life should feel a bit threatened.
