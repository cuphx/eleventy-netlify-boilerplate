I almost forgot to mention that I had a short-short piece accepted for publication in [Nanoism](http://twitter.com/#!/nanoism/), a twitter-based literary project. It's posted [there](http://twitter.com/#!/nanoism/status/175657058899730432), but I'm reprinting it as well:

_She asked for a water birth. Maybe I should have suspected, but there was never that much detail in the old selkie stories._

I enjoy reading Nanoism on my twitter feed, you should check it out. (And believe it or not, it is a paying market!)
