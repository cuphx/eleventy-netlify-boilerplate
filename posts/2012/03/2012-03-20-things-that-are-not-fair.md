You may remember how, all of two days ago, I announced that I was not going to acquire any new books that I had not already preordered [until the end of the year](http://jackwren.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/the-year-of-good-intentions/ "the Year of Good Intentions").

I am being _sorely tested,_ guys. In the 48 hours or so since I posted that, two bloggers I follow have posted free books for download _and_ I got an email that [Indiana University Press](http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/) is having a 50% off sale through Thursday.

This includes [Of Gods and Men: Studies in Lithuanian Mythology](http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?cPath=1037_1131&products_id=20180), which you can't even find used for less than $30 but is $18 on sale, along with scholarly book on the Kalevala.

I don't know what to do! Seriously, if it wasn't a book that I'd been trying to track down but couldn't locate in a local library, I'd be able to push it aside, but... I am _so, so tempted_ right now.

Should I stick to the promise I made, guys? If I break down two days in, am I a total failure? Or is this a special situation? (Or is someone willing to buy it as a present to get me a loophole that way?)

Tell me what to do! I have until Thursday.
