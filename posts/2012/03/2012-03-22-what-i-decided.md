There was going to be a post about Ostara ritual tonight, but guys, I'm not gonna lie. It was snowing when I left work, and I have a really hard time celebrating spring when it's _fucking snowing in late March_. So instead I am going to revisit [yesterday's conundrum](http://jackwren.wordpress.com/2012/03/20/things-that-are-not-fair/ "Things That Are NotÂ Fair").

Thank you all for the suggestions, first of all. It's amazing how much it helps to talk it out. I will tell you what I decided, and why.

On the free books, I decided to forgo them, at least for now. Part of the reason for doing the exercise was to make me appreciate what I have rather than just mindlessly acquiring more. Sure, mindlessly-acquired ebooks don't take up any space, but they have psychological weight. I see them, and I know I haven't read them. Also I've gotten to the point of being slightly compulsive about hunting down free ebooks, or even buying inexpensive ones. I do it without really thinking about whether I'm actually going to read them.

As for _Of Gods and Men,_ most of you thought I should get it because I've wanted it for some time, and I decided you guys are right. The point is not to mindlessly deny myself; the point is to be thoughtful and intentional about the books I acquire. Buying this book, which I've wanted for a while and happens to be on a very good sale, makes complete sense.

So thank you guys for you advice! It definitely helped.
