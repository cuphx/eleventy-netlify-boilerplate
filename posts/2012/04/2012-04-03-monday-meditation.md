So, yes, last week was an Anxiety Party. It was not fun. This week is better, but only nominally and by comparison. Posting's probably going to remain a little light for that reason.

Of course, the time when I would most benefit from meditation is when it is the hardest to do it. I ended up dutifully sitting, watching my mind, trying to calm it and failingÂ miserably. (Monkey Mind, I am the poster boy for it.)

So I've been sitting. It just doesn't feel like it's doing me a lot of good at the moment. But I guess I just keep doing it.
