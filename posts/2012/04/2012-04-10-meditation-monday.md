You know, I think people who recommend meditation for anxiety are mostly full of it.

I mean, I'm sure there's a way to get something out of it, but when I'm having serious anxiety, trying to sit with my thoughts is nigh on impossible. My thoughts are the _problem_.

Nonetheless, I've tried. I did some walking meditation around my work schedule today and heard a frog, which was a nice moment of nature near my office.

I'm hoping that now that the anxiety's backing off, I can get back to focusing.
