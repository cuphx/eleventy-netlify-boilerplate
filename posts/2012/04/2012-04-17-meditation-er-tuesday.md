The weekend was beautiful and I got some really quality quiet time in, especially on Sunday.

And then of course I came into work on Monday and everything was blowing up. Maybe I should start writing this post on Sundays instead.

I spent about an hour sitting outside on Sunday on the PSU campus, watching the interactions between the various animals: crows, pidgeons, dogs, people. It wasn't formal meditation by a long shot, and I'm okay with thatÂ - I think that formality is still very useful, but is not always conducive to what I should be getting out of ADF-style meditation.

If nothing else, nature spirits seem pretty informal, in my experience. If I want to "experience nature," formality is not going to be the way to do it.
