This weekend was beautiful. Absolutely gorgeous. Today dawned the same, and knowing I had to go to work in a cubicle in a windowless room was ridiculously hard, but I did it anyway.

I got to spend some quality time outside this weekend, though, which was nice. I didn't notice any particular animal omens this weekend. Amber and I did some walking meditation on Sunday, which was a nice change of pace. I think we'll be doing it more often.

I probably should be looking at ramping up my meditation - most of the anxiety from that spike has passed, but I'm stuck in a bit of a downswing. I need to clear my head. I have a couple of ideas on how to do that. One of them is to get myself crafting again, because I know that kind of single-minded focus really does clear my head. Besides that, though, just sitting more would probably benefit me as well.
