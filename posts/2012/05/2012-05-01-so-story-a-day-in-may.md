So last year I took a swing at something called Story-a-Day May. The concept is pretty straightforward: one story a day for the whole month. I got about half that last year, which I think is not bad for a first try.

This year I'm doing it again, but this time I decided I wanted a little structure to help it along. I found a great community called [rainbowfics](http://rainbowfic.dreamwidth.org) that offers sets of prompts, and so I'm going to have 30 prompts to see me through the month.

I'm planning to write primarily for Lost the Sky, since I'm working on a longer Epsilon piece right now, but we'll see how inspiration strikes... and if it doesn't strike at all, well, measures may have to be taken.
