Here's a short post for my ADF writeups:

Integrity is a know-it-when-you-see-it virtue for me.

When I say something about an organization or a person, even if I'm saying it in confidence, I ask myself how I would feel if that person, or someone from that organization, heard/read it. If I'm not prepared to back it up, I don't say it.

Sometimes integrity means saying or doing the unpleasant thing, too. What's right is not always what's easy, or what people want to hear, after all. I do my best, because that's all I can do.

In the pagan community, there are more specific kinds of integrity. For example, there's the integrity required of anyone who does divination for others. It can be hard to say what the cards or runes or dice say, rather than what you think you could say. We all want to be right, but if you believe the cards are anything more than a psychological prompt, you have to take the chance on what they say, instead of what you say.
