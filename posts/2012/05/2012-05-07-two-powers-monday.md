Yep, its Monday, time to talk about this week's mediation. We didn't get to go out and do any nature walking this weekend.On Saturday that was because we spent half the day trekking out to Trout Lake Abbey. Rev. Thomas's ritual included my first go at a Two Powers meditation, and I have to say it worked for me. I was hesitant to try it on my own because guided mediation stuff rarely clicks for me, but I think I'll be giving it time in the future.

I also got some ideas for a deity-focused, non-ADF style meditation, but I'll save that for another post.

Sunday I didn't get but a few minutes of mediation on the train, but that was on my way back from A Gathering Of Guilds, which is an annual event where half a dozen handcraft guilds take over the convention center and sell things, have demos, etc. I'm sure Am will talk about the fiber artists over at Ripping Back. The Metal Arts Guild wasn't doing a lot of demos on Sunday, so I spent most of my time with the glassworkers and the woodcrafters.

I like glasswork, though I've yet to take any lessons in it. It's not unlike metalwork, though - using fire to shape the materials of the earth. There was a lot of time spent simply spinning the project, watching how the glass melted and studying the patterns. It reminded me of all the things I love about smithing specifically.

And then there were the woodcarvers. Handcarving is one of those things that I've thought about doing but shied away from committing to. (OCD, perfectionism, excused, etc) However, the work looked so peaceful... and the row of Santas and wizards he had carved made me think that maybe this was the ticket to having a statue for Odin that I like. (Beyond the chibi action figure I got when Thor came out, of course. Because while that is hilarious, its not really suited to srs ritual.)

So not only did I actively experience a new style of meditation this weekend, I was reminded of another that I should return to as well. Not bad, all in all.
