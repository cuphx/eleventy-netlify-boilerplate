Every time I'm even _close_ to being caught up at work something changes. This time they decided to change how they wanted a certain form filled out for our last deadline after we'd already handed in everything for that deadline.

Yeah, awesomesauce. So I've been working on meditation to calm my stupid monkey perfectionist brain.

Mostly this week I've been experimenting with a shortened version of the Two Powers meditation. I can do it in about two minutes now - water comes up, fire comes down, all is good. I don't know that being able to do it quickly should actually be a _goal_ but it means I can take a few minutes away from my desk, walk outside to a grassy patch, and get my zen on.
