So the internet's been out in my apartment all weekend. This is the point at which the perk of not having a separate internet bill runs up against the annoyance of not being able to do anything about it except try to find the property manager when it's not working.

The lack of internet is bugging me, not just because I can't do some of the things I want to be working on, but also because I'm the kind of ridiculous nerd technopagan that uses the wireless network in the apartment as part of the wards and even if I can leave it running without the internet, I feel like something's missing.

Work is driving me batty, not for any big reason, but because a ton of little things are coming together in ways that set off my anxiety. It's getting old, believe me, and I'm doing my best to focus on what I can do.

I did get some writing done this weekend, and a lot of reading, and some work on my inspiration book. On Saturday, I finally got my butt outside into the courtyard near my apartment to sit in the green space there. I've talked to the tree that's right outside my apartment window a bit, but never in this green space on the other side of the building from me.

I didn't get any response from land wights or anything along those lines, but I wasn't expecting one right away. I'll keep it up and see how that works out.

In addition to getting that one big meditation time in, I'm also doing my best to get in five minutes here and there, especially at work when I need to unplug.

So... not a whole lot to report, huh? Sorry. What do you usually do when you don't have internet?
