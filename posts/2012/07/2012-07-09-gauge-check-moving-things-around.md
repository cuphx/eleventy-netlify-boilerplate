Amber and I both did some work on the apartment this week. Nothing big or life-changing, not even really anything furniture moving. Just some little things and some straightening-up that has helped. I also reorganized Mara's shrine (again) - she's a little picky sometimes, but I can't really complain.

I spent most of Saturday hiding in the dark from a headache. I blame the heat. Oh, it's not nearly so bad here as it is in the rest of the country but it's still a bit much for my taste and of course we don't make it as easy to hide from here as we did in Arizona.

Today I went to the library and to an off-season NaNoWriMo meetup. I'm getting ready for another writing challenge in August, which means there's a chance this blog will be a little quieter while my writing blog will be a little busier. If you miss me, you're welcome to look for me [over there](http://jackadreams.info/blog/).

I do have a couple of projects I'm working on for this blog that I would like to have ready to go before then, but that's going to depend on how work looks.

Right now, work is... let's just say that I've got _no idea_ what to do to make it better, so I'm rolling with it in the hopes it'll take me somewhere. I don't want to have to switch jobs, guys, so I'm hoping this picks up. Actually, I wouldn't mind switching jobs if I was switching to, like, full-time metal sculptor, but I'm not there yet. ;)

I'm doing some digital cleanup this week as well, sorting my ebooks and backing them up. Next up is my music collection. Then, maybe my digital pictures... but maybe not, I haven't decided yet. It keeps me from going through the apartment tossing things, though.

When I get to the stage where I'm looking around the apartment for things to toss, I know the stress is messing with me. I just don't know what to do about it yet. I'm planning to pick up Jason Miller's [Financial Sorcery](http://amzn.com/B008H3TY86) and see what he has to say. I've had pretty decent luck borrowing some ideas from [R. O.](http://headforred.blogspot.com/2012/03/favor-of-kings.html) in the past so I might revisit that as well.

If that doesn't do it, well, I'll buy some copper tape and some silver solder and get to work making jewelry in my copious free time.
