So, having finished [Financial Sorcery](http://amzn.com/B008H3TY86), I rounded up the list of things in the book that jumped out at me enough that I want to take further time with them.

1\. Miller goes into a great deal of detail about ideas for a wealth altar. I have a wealth altar already- Mara's altar easily fills that position for me. She shares space with Ganesha and Lakshmi/Laima, two of the deities he recommends, and is already pretty solid, in my opinion. That doesn't mean it can't be improved, of course, but I think the necessary change is more to make it a working altar with petitions, spells, and an upgrade of the devotions I'm currently doing.

2\. Related to that, Miller details the creation of a "Jupterian cashbox" for drawing in money. I'm planning to create one of these using a wooden box I picked up at a yard sale a couple of weeks ago. Need to do some sanding on it and then I'll break out the woodburning tools and see how it comes out.

3\. Miller talks about the planetary correspondences at several points. I'm not quite sure how I feel about them. I haven't done anything along these lines since I was into Catholic and high magic about ten years ago and never really got into it.

Since I'm not particularly interested in Roman gods or angelic powers, I'm going to need to take some time to sit with this. There's a lot of power in it and there's a lot of use to it, so I do want to pursue it. I'm leaning towards exploring either the Norse gods related to the planets or taking a more chaos magic route...

See, I was having a conversation with my friend [Tom](http://serpentinetom.wordpress.com/) about using the cast of Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon for archetypal pathworking, and it occurred to me that that might also be a way I can approach the planetary powers from a pop culture angle.

(Anybody reading have any suggestions?)

4\. For myself, I'm interested in a couple of pieces of spellwork described. I'm interested in the invocation for business ideas; I have a lot of vague concepts about businesses I'd like to do on the side, but I don't tend to follow through.

Beyond that, I really like the glyphs depicted in the book and I am very excited about empowering some of them and seeing what kind of results I can get. I'm also thinking about doing some of the job-hunting work, in particular the Resume of Mercury and the Cover Letter of Venus, on behalf of [Amber](http://rippingback.wordpress.com).

(Only somewhat related, but I am planning to do some work with the Favor of Kings as outlined by [Rufus Opus](http://headforred.blogspot.com/2012/03/favor-of-kings.html) as well. I think it'll be another good piece of work to do with my wealth altar, to get it busy and working.)

5\. And finally, but perhaps most important, Miller talks about the idea of moving one's set point, the comfort level that we all tend to stick to even when it's to our detriment. This is a bigger project than any one spell, but it's a very important idea and one I'll probably revisit a number of times.

As a part of this, there's a great deal of processing I'll have to do about my relationship with money, my (and Amber's) current expenses, and the like. I will do my best to speak honestly about it here, though I'll do my best not to bore you with too many details.
