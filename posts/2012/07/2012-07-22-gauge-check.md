Hail Mara, who gives the bounty! Hail Laima, who is generous! Hail Ganesha, who is quick-witted! Offerings were made, and overtime hours and another temporary job appeared in return! (Considering no other department in my company has the option of overtime right now, I do consider that a miracle.)

So how has my week been?As you can guess from the above, and from my posting schedule this week, I've been kind of busy. Work has been crazy; of course, it seems like it always is, it's just the individual crazy things that vary.

I haven't started on my Jupiterian cash box yet, need to clear off my workspace and break out the woodburner. (Need to pick up sandpaper, too. How do I not have sandpaper?) Also need to work on something metal-related just to keep my hand in. I found copper foil tape on clearance at a local craft store so I have pretty much everything I need to make some jewelry and keep my hand in, anyway.

Miller recommends working your way through the planets [starting on Monday](http://strategicsorcery.blogspot.com/2009/01/7-planets-are-for-everything.html) and invoking every other day, so I'm planning to start that this week. I also found his Protection and Reversal Magick in the public library, so I'm going to work my way through that. (I have a love/hate relationship with psychic hygiene - I used to be the magical equivalent of the OCD stereotype of washing your hands til they bleed - but I think I'm in a place now where I can come back to it in a healthy manner.)

(Also, I'm seriously not meaning to turn this blog into the Jason Miller Fanboy Hour, I promise.)

I've been writing, which is sort of amazing all things considered. I got some post-apocalyptic stuff done and I'm working on other things in that universe. The big deal is that I'm _going out of my way_ to find writing time. Usually I just attack ideas when they come and lay fallow when they don't, but ever since May's Story a Day project I've been pushing a little harder toward a regular writing practice. And, as you may have noticed, I've been writing here a lot more. Hopefully practicing more will give me more to write about here, and having the blog stare at me balefully will tell me that I should be practicing more.
