Since finishing my round of planetary meditation, I've mostly falling back into my regular habits - almost-daily sitting, usually with a meditation timer app for my phone. Butt on cushion is the most important rule for writing, and it's also the most important for meditating.

And a quick check of dates reminded me of something - my five months of meditation practice and journalling are, essentially, complete now. I made my first Meditation Monday post on March 19th. I'm very glad I started on this project, because getting back in the habit has been very good for me. Now I just have to keep it up.

That's the hard part, of course.
