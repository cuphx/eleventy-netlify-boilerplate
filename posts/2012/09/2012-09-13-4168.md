I was not previously aware of this holiday, not being involved with Neos Alexandria, but I am absolutely in favor of a holiday celebrating books and the joy of the written word. I don't often work with Hermes and I haven't had the pleasure of working with Thoth, but I will happily say Hail Hermes! Hail Thoth! And a bit more relevant to my own practice, I'm inclined to say Hail, Odin, who sacrificed himself to obtain the runes. On that note, I'm aiming to spend my evening writing in celebration of the great gift of letters given us by the gods.
