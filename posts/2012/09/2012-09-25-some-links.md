I recently came across Neos Alexandria's [call for submissions for their Hephaestus devotional](http://neosalexandria.org/bibliotheca-alexandrina/calls-for-submissions/harnessing-fire-a-devotional-anthology-in-honor-of-hephaestus/) and I've been thinking it over. I never clicked with him the way I did with Ilmarinen, but I've been fond of him since I was working with Athena and Artemis, and obviously I have some Thoughts On Forge Gods, so I've been sitting with the idea to see if any inspiration strikes.

Another link I came across was this [fundraiser for an illustrator](http://www.indiegogo.com/help-daniel) who recently had a brain tumor removed at the same hospital where I had mine removed. This is a hospital with amazing facilities and some of the top brain surgeons in the country, but it is not cheap. I was fortunate enough to have insurance that covered most of my expenses at the time, and yet I'm still paying the bill two years later, and will be for a while.

This man wasn't lucky enough to have insurance when his symptoms became serious enough that he couldn't ignore them anymore. If I had left my job when I planned to, I could have easily been in the same situation. I don't have a lot to spare, but I donated. I know a lot of you are in the same situation, but if you have something to spare, I'd encourage you to do the same.
