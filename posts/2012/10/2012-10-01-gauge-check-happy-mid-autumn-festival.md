I don't know that anyone who reads this blog would be inclined to recognize the holiday, but if you do, I hope you had a good time celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival.

This week has been incredibly hit-and-miss for me. Work is ups and downs in a way that produces anxiety that I'm completely unable to do anything about. It feels like everything is up in the air and waiting on something else - not just work, but in my personal life too.

This morning I sat down and re-did Mara's altar again. She's made it extremely clear that she's not going anywhere, and I didn't really expect her to. I'm trying out a new Sunday schedule where altar maintenance is part of my weekly ritual along with clearing temporary things from my Review file, updating my [plan.txt](http://calnewport.com/blog/2008/11/11/plantxt-the-most-effective-productivity-tool-that-youve-never-heard-of/), and generally making sure things are organized and sorted.

The plan.txt thing is a new addition - it adds an element of planning the week ahead on top of the looking back of the review. I plan to try it for a few weeks and see if it helps keep me on track of what matters.

Now if only I trusted myself enough to decide what matters through the anxiety...
