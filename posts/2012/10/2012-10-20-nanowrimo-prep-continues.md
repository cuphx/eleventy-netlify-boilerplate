It's two in the morning and my allergies are keeping me awake, so of course it's time to plot a novel...

The best thing about [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org "NaNoWriMo") is not how much writing I get done - though it's easily my most productive month every year. No, the best thing about NaNo is how much social writing, and talking about writing, I get to do.

My Friday nights, Sunday afternoons, and Monday and Thursday late nights will very likely all be spent in an environment where I'm only writing and hanging out with other writers, doing word wars and making Dr. Who jokes. I'm looking forward to it, and I'm very lucky to have a supportive [partner](http://rippingback.wordpress.com).

I've been much more diligent about my writing lately and I am reminded how much happier I am when I'm writing most of the time. This week in particular, work was rough for me but writing was the thing that kept me out of my usual hamster wheels of despair.

I'm currently diverting myself with a lot of scenes featuring the main character of my novel as he was about eight or nine years before the novel itself takes place, as well as plotting out what I'm going to write in November. The rest of the year, I'm much lighter on my outlining expectations, but NaNo just goes more smoothly when I know what comes next.

So speaking of what comes next, at least in terms of writing, I have some ideas. I've got a small list of creative things I want to finish before November starts. I've got a few blog posts outlined, mostly on Mara, and I have almost all of the rest of the PBP posts at least planned out by letter.

It may not feel like much, but I keep reminded myself that progress is progress, and baby steps are still steps.
