I didn't update last week because my immune system's been quite busy. I didn't accomplish much that week, so you weren't missing anything. I didn't accomplish much this week either, for the same reason. Work messed with my head on a couple of different levels. But this weekend I focused on spending time with [Amber](http://rippingback.wordpress.com), and not much else, and I feel recalibrated.

There's only a few days until NaNoWriMo. I don't quite feel ready, but I have a pretty solid idea, at least. For the first time ever, I took the 31st and the 1st off work. I feel like I'm cheating somehow, but I figure I might as well use my vacation time for holidays that matter to me.

Speaking of holidays, with any luck, my official ADF-approved Samhain celebration will be next weekend out at Trout Lake Abbey. All we've got to worry about out here is rain and I guess earthquakes... no Frankenstorms. All of my family is in the storm's path, though, along with many of my friends. So I'm still thinking about it.

I'm really not a very good child. Filial piety was one of the big hangups for me in eastern thought, and I'm really not any better with the focus on ancestors in heathen and druid circles. I'm great with my spiritual forebears, and I've done my share of family tree research, but I might as well be a changeling for all that I feel attached to my family.

Though I do get some things from them. I get my anxiety spectrum from my father, for example. I knew I was having a bad time of it at work when I let some of the hang ups through the cracks. I think it was just with one coworker - and one I've gotten pretty comfortable with, so it could have been worse. But I'm also worried it was showing in places I didn't realize.

Guess there's nothing for it but to show up tomorrow and hope for the best.
