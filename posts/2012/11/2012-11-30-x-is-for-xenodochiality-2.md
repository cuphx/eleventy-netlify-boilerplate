Like xenophobia, xenodochiality comes from the Greek ξένος, or xenos, meaning stranger. Xenodochiality is a kind of hospitality, something like Blanche's "kindness of strangers." Since I'm not Hellenic, it's not an immediately pagan choice, but (a) x words are hard to come by and (b) the concept is relevant.

I did say I would talk a little more about what Mara asks of me, after all, and one of the things she asks is that I try to be that kind stranger. Aside from traditional giving through larger charities like [Heifer International](http://www.heifer.org/), the [Hero Initiative](http://www.heroinitiative.org/), or Goodwill, there are lots of individuals who need help. These are the Chip-Ins and Indigogo fundraisers you see on your Facebook friends list, the families you hear about on the news that have an account in their name started at a local bank after a tragedy, and even the guy on the corner with a cardboard sign.

Nobody can give to everyone, but in these kinds of situations, a little bit goes a long way. They can help a someone [recover from a fire](http://www.maronefam.com/), [avoid eviction](http://xsnarkasaurus.livejournal.com/220431.html), [pay medical bills](http://help-daniel.com/), [find foster care for a pet](http://snowcoma.livejournal.com/359118.html) or [care for a sick animal](http://www.indiegogo.com/brother-godric).

Being a goddess of wealth, amongst other things, Mara overseas the flow of money. She helps me when I need it to come in, and she nudges me to let me know which direction to send it back out again. Sometimes it's the $5 I have to spare to someone on the internet, and sometimes it's the dollar in my pocket to the guy with the sign or the guitar. There's no perfect solution, but I believe doing this helps create a world where people are more likely to get what they need. I think that's important.

There was a time when a wanderer was welcomed in and fed. There have always been edicts from gods telling their followers to care for those poorer than them. I don't have a lot, but I have more than some people. I view it as my responsibility to them and to the gods I serve to pass on what I can.
