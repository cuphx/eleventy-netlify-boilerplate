One of the things I like about attending the UU church is how much music there is. Singing was always one of my favorite parts of Catholic mass - I was even in the choir for a few years.

After last week, I was prepared to be disappointed by the music this week, but they were minor. In fact, we even did the first verse and chorus of _Come All Ye Faithful_ in the Latin.Â I was not expecting that. I was also not expecting my reaction, which was to pretty much cry like a baby in the middle of church.

Latin mass is one of the many tiny things I can point to, influences that added up to the choices I made getting into magic. Latin mass was one of my first exposures to pure, dramatic ritual - the post-Vatican II style mass never struck me the way the proper mass does. After that, it was a very short road and all downhill to doing rituals for myself, especially once I got past the heartbreak of knowing I could never be a priest.

Some things never really change, do they?

But other things do. Laws, for example. The kinds of laws that allowed me to go out on Saturday with Amber and get a marriage license.

And so, all things considered, I'm feeling pretty good right now.
