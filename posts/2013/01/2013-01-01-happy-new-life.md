Today I prepared for the most important magical working of my life.

I ritually bathed and chanted runes. I prepared the tools and offerings. I tweaked the ritual and wrote my oath. My working partner did the same.

And then we got married.

I don't think I've ever been happier or more sure of a decision.

Second new year's never going to be the same, but I can't think of a better way to move into 2013.
