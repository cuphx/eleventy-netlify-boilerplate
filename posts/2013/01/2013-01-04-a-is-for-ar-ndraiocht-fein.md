Ár nDraíocht Féin is a druid organization founded by Isaac Bonewits. It's one of the larger neo-Druidry organizations and has been active since the 80s. It's been almost a year since I joined the ADF, and therefore it's time to decide whether I'm going to renew my membership or not.

What am I getting out of it? Well, I've done some good work for my DP. I enjoy some of the conversations on the mailing lists. Attending rituals at Trout Lake was a real highlight. And I definitely enjoy the people I've met, particularly some of the local druids.

Of course, I'll still know those people without the ADF, and one doesn't have to be a member to attend rituals at Trout Lake...

The problem is not the ADF or the Dedicant Path itself. The problem is that I've felt so _constrained_ by my ADF membership. Most of this year, I've felt almost guilty picking up anything about a non-IE religion; it was a bit like feeling there was homework I should be doing every time I tried to read for fun. Sure, there are plenty of books on PIE religion I've enjoyed reading or still want to read. That I have a book report still outstanding for the DP, however, doesn't mean I can't read the book I just picked up about exorcism in Song China.

In fairness, that's my hang up, not the DP's fault. Nowhere does it insist that I can't read outside of the PIE hearths. But it doesn't suit me, where I am right now. I think I'll take some time off, and if I change my  mind, I can always go back to it later.
