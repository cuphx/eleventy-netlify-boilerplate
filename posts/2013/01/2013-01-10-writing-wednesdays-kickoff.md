Rather than Fiction Friday, I think I'm going to go with "Writing Wednesday." First of all, because it doesn't require me to actually have a completed story to post every week, and second of all, it seems appropriate since Wednesday is Woden's day and all.

Regarding point one, I have done an excellent job this week of failing to produce a completed story. Oh, how I failed. I've gone through five different ideas now in an attempt to produce something worth sending off to [Imaginary Beasts](http://imaginarybeasts.livejournal.com). It's not that it's hard, not really. I just find myself hating everything after about seven hundred words.

I'm struggling with Things Happening - or, I suppose, Failing To Happen. I'm having a hard time getting from the microcosm of a single conversation to the macrocosm of major conflict right now. My head's in the game, but my heart isn't.

I have three other deadlines at the end of the month, so I'm going to have to get going one way or the other. I can't keep banging my head against this one thing.

That's pretty typical of me, though, to get caught up on one thing I can't do and totally let three other things get away from me. Work's being ridiculous, but work's always going to be ridiculous, I can't use that as an excuse. Personal demons to fight? They're always there too, it seems like.

Sometimes it seems like life is the distractions.

Anyway, back to writing...
