Aslan is not, strictly speaking, my god. I do have a relationship with him, but I have it primarily because he's important to my wife. I'm something of a Gnostic Narnian - I believe Narnia itself was an imperfect world created by a very human author.

Funny story, I actually considered myself a Gnostic Catholic the last time I tried working with Jesus. As you might imagine, it didn't work out. I have a hard time working with the Power of Light. The Light is an energy of cleansing, of exaltation, of ascension. Of perfection. I struggle with perfection, even as I acknowledge the existence of pure Words and Powers.Â Every face of the Enlightened One is like a mask to me, a proud smile that seems to belie disappointment with my imperfections.

I even have a hard time with unconditional love. For complicated, broken-brainy reasons, I really don't believe that I'm worth being loved that way. It's easier for me to work with those who require an active relationship of give and take, like Mara or Odin. (My wife is doing her best to change my mind, but it's slow going.)

The path of Light, ascension, and is one of the more popular paths to perfection. I don't know that it's fair to say that it's easier, since I don't see a lot of people making it to the top, but it is probably the easiest to find. It's well lit, after all.

It helps that Light is a power that's well-known and valued in our society. Even those who don't explicitly follow a host of the Enlightened One tend to be quick to assure others that their path is full of "love and light" and certainly not any of that icky darkness or chaos.

The thing about Light, though, it that it blinds. Too much light is just as bad for you as too little - there's skin cancer to worry about, and retinal damage, and so on. For every Mother Theresa, there's a Fred Phelps (and Mother Theresa wasn't perfect either.) Darkness makes you confront the worst parts of yourself. Light can cleanse you of them, but it can also blind you to them. Like everything else, it has two sides.

I particularly like Aslan as a host of the Enlightened One because, as he will remind you, he is not a tame Lion. The path of Light is presented as the easy and accessible one, but it's not easy to walk, just easy to find.
