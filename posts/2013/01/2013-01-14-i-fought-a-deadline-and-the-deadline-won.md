So I spent the last two weeks trying to write something for Imaginary Beasts. I ended up going through at least five totally different story ideas, including three that were solid enough to be called 'first drafts'.

Today I gave up, handed the best draft over to [Amber](http://rippingback.wordpress.com), and told her I didn't want to see it again. There are definite perks to having a co-writer.

I don't know that it'll be done in time for the deadline, but I have faith it'll get done, and in a much better form than it was when I admitted I couldn't do it by myself.

Now onto the next project! And possibly all the next Project Protagonist post. Any requests for that?
