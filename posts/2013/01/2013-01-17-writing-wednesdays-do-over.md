Having given up on my first deadline of the month, I realized that my second - a month-long, goal-oriented challenge - was nearly half over with nothing to show for it. Luckily, the start and end dates for that one had some leeway, so I was able to "restart" on the 14th. It's slow but steady going, and at this point that is a relief.

This is me taking what I can get.

I'm also hoping to do some more blog posting. I'm enjoying Project Protagonist so far but I'm having a hard time finding a schedule for it. I'm just loosely hoping to add a post a week for the subjects on the list.

Hopefully next week I'll have some fiction to share here again...
