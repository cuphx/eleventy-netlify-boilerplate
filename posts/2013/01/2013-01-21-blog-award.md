I completely forgot to post about this! The very kind [Anne](http://randomcardrolodex.wordpress.com/) gifted me with a Liebster Award last week.

_"The Liebster Award is given to up and coming bloggers who have less than 200 followers. The word "Liebster" comes from German and can mean the sweetest, kindest, nicest, dearest, most beloved, lovely, kind, pleasant, valued, cute, endearing, and welcome."_

I'm supposed to answer some questions and make up some random facts, but to be honest, if I waited until I had the attention span to do that, the tab with her very generous recommendation would be sitting open for weeks. Instead of nominating other blogs, I'm going to suggest you check out the [other sites she nominated](http://randomcardrolodex.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/1404/) and the links in my sidebar if you haven't already.

If that's not enough to keep you busy, you might also want to check out:

- [Carl Sagan and the Pale Blue Dot](http://zenpencils.com/comic/100-carl-sagan-pale-blue-dot/)
- [Sarduríur’s Academic Sources Guide for the Unversed](http://warboar.wordpress.com/2013/01/18/sasg/) is great if you're not familiar with the use of academic sources
- [Jennett's Guide to Evaluating a Website](http://www.ecauldron.com/forum/showthread.php?5748-Traditional-Witchcraft&p=92543#post92543) is also pretty awesome, and people who seem to think anything you find on Google is a valid resource should be directed here
