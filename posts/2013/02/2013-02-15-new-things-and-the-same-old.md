You may have noticed it being a little quieter lately. There's a couple of reasons for that. The big, obvious one is that I'm going back to school.

Apparently I just didn't feel like I had enough to do with myself. No, that's a lie. I have a few things keeping me busy, but I could be doing more. So I signed up for more.

I'm not very good at settling or relaxing. They're just not things I do. Right now there's things at work setting off my OCD really badly, and homework is actually a really good distraction for me. It keeps me facing forward and moving.

So I expect to be largely MIA for a few weeks, though I intend to keep doing the PBP posts, and I'll probably do at least one other post a week - maybe a Project Protagonist post, or maybe Â a check-in like this, or maybe a Writing Wednesday. Maybe more than one. I tend to get more done when I'm busy.

All of this combines to make me... less than social, though. I'm not on instant messenger as much, and I'm not on Dreamwidth, and I'm just not up for dealing with a lot of people-ness. All my social points are getting spent at work.

I'm writing this as much for myself as for you guys - if you're like me, you don't really notice whether a blog gets updated once a week or five times, you're just reading whatever comes through your feed reader. It can be weeks of silence before it occurs to me that I'm not seeing much from a given person.

Writing it out helps me process my feelings and what's getting stuck where, so that I'm better able to attack it. So, here it is in black and white. (Or cream and dark grey, I guess.) Let's see where I am next week, okay? Hopefully it'll be better.
