I grew up a plant in the dark, overshadowed and unsure what sunlight was, reaching for it anyway, confused when I found myself with a handful of stardust or moon rocks or broken glass. Not sunlight, as everyone was quick to point out. I've built myself a greenhouse out of old windows and wire. I get pretty good reception out here and it'll help gather up all the sunlight that's going to come any day now, when they all move out of the way.

I'm spending all this time, though, with sparkling glass shards and stardust, shiny rocks and bits of tin foil. I'm not so worried anymore about that sun I've never seen.
