Hail the Generous Lady who makes all things affordable! Prosperity is her handmaiden! Comfort is her servant! Patience and reverence are rewarded with blessings from her hands. I sing the praises of the one who helps secure employment! I hail the name of the one who makes security possible! Hail, Dear Mara! Hail, Sweet Mara! Hail, Great Mara, and thank you!
