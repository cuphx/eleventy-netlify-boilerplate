Sometimes I struggle a great deal with the details I share here. I wonder how I come off to y'all, both my regular readers and random passersby. Do I overemphasize the negative? Do I sound too perfect?

I second guess myself a lot. Social anxiety and OCD meet at Social Scrupulousity Park, where I worry that I'm a terrible person and everyone was right to hate me in high school. I still worry I'll say the wrong thing and hurt people. I've done it before, I'll do it again.

I get caught up in these thoughts and I shy away from blogging. I know that's not an answer, but sometimes an answer seems too far away and besides, I could be doing homework or something. I've got plenty of excuses.

I'm better, though, when I'm not ignoring things. Keeping busy keeps me from getting too hung up. I'm thinking about trying to post every day this month, to see if it keeps me thinking. What do you think?
