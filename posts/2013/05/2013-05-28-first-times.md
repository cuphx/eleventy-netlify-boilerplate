When I was little, I'd spend my summers at my grandmother's house. I ended up watching a lot of PBS, not just Sesame Street and Electric Company but also shows like Bob Ross and This Old House. I've been a DIY show addict since then - I spent many high school weekends watching the old design block on Discovery (is Lynette Jennings still on TV?), and HGTV was pretty much the greatest invention ever.

And yet today was the first time I ever painted a room.

It sounds a little ridiculous, doesn't it? But until this place, I've always lived in rentals that didn't believe in painting. The only reason we get to paint here is because the landlord didn't get a chance to repaint it before we moved in, actually, but I'll take what I can get.

It was both easier and harder than I anticipated. The blue painter's tape didn't want to stay stuck to the baseboard, so I ended up freehanding the edges on the wall by the door. I think the lines are just as good as the ones with the tape, to be honest.

It ended up being easier than I thought it would be. And now we can start hanging art in the bedroom!

I also helped my wife in the kitchen during dinner. I cut the veggies and prepared them for roasting, and watched as she explained how she was cooking the salmon we got at the farmer's market over the weekend. I would have told you that even roasting veggies was beyond me, but I guess it isn't.

Did I mention we're starting from scratch with my cooking skills? Because I am.

I did, however, find something to help at the thrift this weekend.Â _Two boxes_ of vintage recipes. One is from 1984 and the other is some classic Americana from 1976. I figure this will either result in tastiness or hilarity. Come back next week to find out which!
