[Sundown](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/648994832/sundown-whispers-of-ragnarok-norse-myth-song-cycle) - This is a Kickstarter for a musical about the Norse myths. If you click through, there are a couple of samples available for listening. I particularly recommend listening to "My Brother, My Enemy."

In other Odin-related news, check out this [call for submissions](http://wytchofthenorth.wordpress.com/2013/05/29/call-for-submissions-prayers-to-the-allfather/) for an anthology of prayers and rituals devoted to Ol' Blue Eye. I'm looking forward to seeing what results from it.
