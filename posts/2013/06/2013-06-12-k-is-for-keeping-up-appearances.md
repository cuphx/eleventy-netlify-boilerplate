This post is, you may have noticed, late.

I had a bit of a crash last month, and into this one. I'm supposed to be willing to talk my mental health, so I'm trying to talk about it. Basically work and school both became overwhelming in ways that were difficult for me to set aside and my anxiety skyrocketed. Leaving work at work was impossible, and being there six days a week made it worse.

It's not really "better" in any quantifiable way. Some of the workload has shifted in a way that's taken some burden off me, I suppose. But it's like a switch flipped in my head. I am out of fucks. I used up my last one.

I've been working on fiction projects, and making some decent headway there. But I had been focusing my attention on the Theos Logos stuff, and when they collective pagan internet freaked out about people worshipping [Batman](http://sonsofthebatman.blogspot.com/) or [Celestia](http://friendshipispagan.tumblr.com/) I... just didn't have enough spare energy to care. So I stopped posting.

I'm not going to pretend it isn't ridiculous. But I thought about trying to keep posting even though I felt like crap, because I didn't want people to think I was broken.

Then I figured, fuck it. Y'all know I'm broken. I've talked about it before. And it's not nobody's ever gone quiet for a few weeks in the history of the Wordpress, right?

So there. That's one K down.
