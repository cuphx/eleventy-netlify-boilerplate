Sometimes it's just hard to talk about what you're doing.

Maybe it's because you're doing it all internally. The ineffable feeling of connectedness is hard to convey in words. I'm a big fan of words, and as you may have gathered, writing is a big part of my life and of my practice, but I don't have words for everything. Sometimes I have words, but they don't come right away.

Maybe it's because the actions themselves are mundane. I can only explain the spiritual experience of a clean house so many times. To be honest, I do have more House Work posts in mind, but I have to actually figure out how to say what I want to say.

There are things I do that are... well, between me and my gods. Or me and my spouse and our gods. I don't refer to them much because I feel that's rude, but it's another category of why I may not be writing.

I wish I could share more eloquently, or that I had more to share. There are plenty of blogs I read that talk about fabulous experiences, or serious Work, and I find myself fascinated. And yet I know I don't have time for that right now. It's a matter of priorities, yes, and while the gods come first, sometimes they are kind enough to give me the time to get my head on straight. While I'm willing to talk about mental illness, I also don't want to bore you to death with my ramblings.

So yes, sometimes I don't write about what I'm doing. But believe me, if I was doing anything worth talking about, you guys would be the first to hear it.
