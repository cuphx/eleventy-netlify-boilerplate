Mara wants me to keep the house.

I've come to appreciate a lot of it. Having a dishwasher helps, but there are still things I wash and dry by hand. I like the accomplishment of finishing a load of laundry or clean counter-tops or a swept floor. I work on my projects.

It's not that she doesn't want me to accomplish great things or praise her name. She likes it when I [praise her](http://mara.jackofmanytrades.info/ "Dear Mara"). She likes it when I write about her, or tend her altar. But she also likes it when I clean the counters and sweep the floor.

You would think, with all the pagan hearth goddesses and kitchen witches, you'd hear about this more. Maybe I'm just not reading the right blogs; I could have sworn I used to be able to read about this in a pagan context more often. But I have fifteen blog posts about cute pantry organization saved in Pocket right now, and about half of those blogs refer to doing things for a higher power. Most of them are Mormon; all of them are Christian. So... Anybody have any recs for the pagan Martha Stewart? The polytheistic Flylady? Or maybe just a good way to organize my pantry that doesn't involve Church-mandated preparedness?
