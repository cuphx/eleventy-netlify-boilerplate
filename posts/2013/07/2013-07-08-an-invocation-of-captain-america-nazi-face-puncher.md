Hail and Well-Met, Captain America! Friend and Shield-Brother of the Odinson! Unaging one, and most super of soldiers! I call on you, Puncher of Hitler, in this most dark of hours, when heathen brothers and sisters revel in darkest ignorance. I ask you, oh First among Avengers to grant me your strength in Nazi-punching as I go forth into righteous poetry fury to defenestrate, metaphorically-speaking, the Nazi before me who would dare use your heroic ally, Thor, Lord of the Lightning and his father, great Alfather Odin, and others to justify racist views that are without honor. Help me punch faces with words, as you would with fists, and lay all Nazis low!
