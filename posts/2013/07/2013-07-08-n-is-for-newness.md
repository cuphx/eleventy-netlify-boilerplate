Fresh starts are appealing. 

Something new is full of possibilities, not yet burdened down with plans that never came to fruition or things that didn't work out the way you wanted. It's easy to tell yourself that _this_ time will be different, this time it will all work out and there won't be any problems. 

And isn't that a lovely thing to believe?

It's not true, of course. The same hangups are still there, regardless of what you do. The reasons you failed are probably going to still exist, unless you yourself have dealt with them. 

But newness is so very tempting... a fresh canvas, and the promise of all new mistakes to be made.

What would you do differently, if you had a new beginning? How can you make that happen now?
