_The Five Elements_

The Deep Blue Sea knows the Dark well, and they hide together in the deepest trenches and whisper secrets in the language of whales.

The Good Earth knows a great deal about reaching toward the Light. She may never reach it, not really, but She gains much in the attempt and shares it with all.

The Two Man Con know both Chaos and Order a little too well - Fire burns out of control all too quickly, and yet carefully controlled burns can stop wildfires. Wind is the province of the mind and intellect, powering ships and mills, but too much leaves you digging out of storm damage.

The Iron Core rests at the center of everything - the planet, the sun, the blood and the computer. It is both solid and liquid, utterly necessary and completely foreign.

_The Five Aspects_

Intuition is the province of the Dark and the unconscious mind, where She speaks loudest without being heard. The Dark Lady teaches you to listen.

Reason is undoubtably the language of Order, wherein each concept or process is laid out by Him, step by step. The Artificer teaches you to study.

The Light speaks in inspiration, the moment of bright clarity where all becomes clear. Once the answer is obvious, He lights the path. The Enlightened One teaches you to see.

Chaos, finally, speaks through emotion. What is experienced this way may not make sense, but that does not make Her lessons any less real. The Mad One teaches you to feel.

(void) does not speak. Nonetheless, we can listen to Hir. This has been given many names, but I think the best is no-mind. (void) teaches you to be.
