My favorite writing community is currently having a flash fiction challenge. The image prompts are assigned by the moderator and the rule is that you can't spend more than an hour on the story.

Timed prompt challenges are perhaps the single best thing to get me writing. In fact, I've written eighteen shorts since Saturday. I'm feeling pretty good about that, even if they're all fairly short pieces. Progress is still progress.
