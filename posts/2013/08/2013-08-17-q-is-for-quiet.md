As in... it's been pretty quiet lately, huh?

I'm actually working on a couple of different posts, and may well get back to posting more often soon. I'd like to start doing a "what I read this week" sort of round up. I've been doing a lot of fiction writing the last two weeks, and messing with things for [Mara's shrine](http://bountifulearth.tumblr.com).

I'm still not sure how I feel about the Tumblr format for that.

Part of the reason for the quiet is that I've been busy offline - work, school and various other irons in the fire. Mara came through on a boon I asked of her, so I'm going to be writing her a book. This should be interesting. I'm not yet sure what I want to do with that, I'm sort of hoping for a sign.

In the meantime, I'm just sort of... plugging away at other things, and the blog gets pushed to the side when I don't have anything to say. I know there's not really anythingÂ _wrong_ with silence, but I always feel bad when there's not much going on here.
