Starting out is hard.

I don't know whether starting out was easier or harder in 1939, but I was thinking about it today when reading [an article about a zine Bradbury did](http://www.openculture.com/2013/08/revisit-futuria-fantasia-the-science-fiction-fanzine-ray-bradbury-published-as-a-teenager.html) in 1939 and 1940 being [available on Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?query=Futuria+Fantasia+by+Ray+Bradbury).

Bradbury is actually one of the authors who made me want to write. I remember reading [All Summer in a Day](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8502328/1/All-Summer-in-a-Day-By-Ray-Bradbury) when I was about Margot's age, nine or ten and all but friendless at school. I remember thinking,Â _oh, this is what it feels like to be understood._

I remember wanting to give that feeling to someone else, and so I started writing.

Hail and thank you, Ray Bradbury! I may not be Rowling, but I am who I am because of you.
