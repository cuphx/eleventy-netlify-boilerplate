Nobody did Quan Yin last week for Q?

Well then, I'm going to have to step up and do something, because Kuan Yin (awkwardly romanized or not) is one of the most amazing goddesses I've had the pleasure of interacting with and really the world does not need another post about Queerness (especially after somebody's attempt last week to define 'queer enough').

Kuan Yin, as y'all probably know, is the bodhisattva of compassion. She doesn't bother going around judging whether people are Buddhist enough, or pagan enough, or queer enough. She doesn't hold it against you if you just had a nervous breakdown and sabotaged your relationship or hurt yourself. She just looks at you kind of sad, because _why would you do that_, except she knows the answer, and when you don't know she gives you a little hug and she smiles at you and that smile is the worst part, because you know she wishes you weren't in pain but she accepts you as someone who hurts.

Sometimes I look at my wife and think, _you are so much more perfect than me, and so much more than I deserve._

I look at Kuan Yin that way pretty much all the time. She's so... I don't understand how she puts up with me, except that it's her nature to do so.

And if I asked her, she'd say she's only seeing what I am, or whatever. Maybe she's right; maybe it's possible to love a monster. My wife seems to be doing her damnedest to prove to me that's its possible. I should take their word for it.
