I have a problem, and that problem's name is Kindle Books.

According to my Amazon account, I currently have 629 books for the Kindle. I've read less than a hundred of them. Many of these were free downloads, some were impulse buys, and I'm sure there's plenty I started and never finished.

I think it's time to do something about that. I've printed out a list of all my Kindle books (since Amazon makes it so hard to see the list at once) and I'm going to read everything I haven't read, and review everything I haven't reviewed.

Or at least I'm going to try and see how far I get before I give up.
