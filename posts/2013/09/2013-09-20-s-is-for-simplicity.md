I was wondering what to write about this week, mostly having no idea. Fortunately, a friend of mine [wrote about Simplicity](http://shezep.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/simplicity/), and I thoughtÂ _yeah, I could write about that._

I find that, the simpler my practice is, the more I get out of it.

It turned out that Mara would rather have simple and personally meaningful than complex and stressful. When the act gets too complicated, I end up spending more time thinking about what I'm doing and less about her. I do a candle every night, to briefly meditate in her, but the more formal altar tending is weekly at her suggestion.

I suppose, in the interest of simplicity, I can leave this thought here and encourage you to go read the post I linked instead.
