Here's some stuff I've enjoyed this month:

[Conundrums](http://theinfinitebattleblog.wordpress.com/2013/09/14/conundrums/) - _It amuses me to note that what Loki asked from me (practically demanding as I moaned about needing sleep when He flooded my mind with ideas) on this year’s Lokablot, to make Him art, is that that _is_ my life._ Yes, this. We can use our gifts to serve the gods, but too often there's a missed step in there.

[S is for… the Shadow and the Flame](http://leithincluan.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/s-is-for-the-shadow-and-the-flame/) - _I sit and watch Afagddu for a while, but I feel very little. I’m worried that I’m ‘getting it wrong’._ _And then I look at Creirwy._ An extremely thoughtful account of a meditation and a lesson from Naomi.

[Seattle Magic](http://redcloakregister.wordpress.com/2013/09/12/pbp-s-seattle-magic/) - _As I am fond of telling people back in the Midwest “Washington is Magic”. Because this place really does just _feel_ like magic._ This captures similar things to how I feel about Portland.

[Witch Skills: Shielding](http://www.moragspinner.net/witch-skills-shielding/) - _The key thing to remember about shielding is this: keep it personal._ Shielding is something I still struggle with, off and on, and reading about how other people do it always gives me new ideas. Morag has some nifty ones.

[Starting My Own Tradition](http://nornoriel.dreamwidth.org/248398.html) - _So as things stand, I'm done with trying to shoehorn myself into other people's traditions and make the proverbial oddly-shaped peg fit the round hole._ Though it's obviously a different tradition than the one I'm working on, this echoes a lot of my feelings about Theos Logos and DIY religion.

[She Calls Me Priest](http://rockofeye.wordpress.com/2013/08/28/she-calls-me-priest/) - I don't really have a pull quote for this one. It's long. It's complex and detailed. It's also pretty brilliant and I haven't seen it get nearly enough traffic.
