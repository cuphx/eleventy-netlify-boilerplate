It may not be a paying market, but I've wanted to submit something to [Imaginary Beasts](http://imaginarybeasts.livejournal.com/) since it first came online back in 2007. It seemed like something always came up and I never quite made it.

Until this issue, [Imaginary Beasts #41: Superpowers](http://imaginarybeasts.livejournal.com/66747.html).

My story, [In Mercy's Shadow, Nothing Grows](http://ib-archive.livejournal.com/107703.html), is set in my Epsilon universe and features a pair of supers dealing with an unexpected wake-up call.
