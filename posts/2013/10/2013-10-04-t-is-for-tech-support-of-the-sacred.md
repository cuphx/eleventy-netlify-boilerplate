In the ongoing search for a word that encompasses certain skillsets that are usually described as "shamanism" without the baggage and cultural appropriation of that word, I came across the term "Technician of the Sacred." I really liked that terminology, though the Virtual Adept in me took it a step forward.

My work is a bit more like Tech Support of the Sacred. I'm not a big-picture idea person, really - I don't run huge rituals and I don't like being the center of attention. I'd much rather be the guy setting things up ahead of time, laying down the wards, running the lights from the other side of the auditorium.

I do a little more of the behind the scenes work - connecting ideas that haven't quite come together, poking things into place, plugging in wires and dropping links. Frankly, I'm glad my job isn't any more exciting than it is.
