Yep, it's that time of year, isn't it?

When I was a kid, there were lots of things I wished I could find in books but never came across. I figured that when I grew up I could be a famous author and write those books I'd always wanted.

Well, I'm not a famous author, but I think maybe it's time I took a crack at those middle grade novels I want to exist. So yes, this year for NaNo I'm writing middle grade fantasy. I figured NaNo is perfect because the word count is right around the range for middle grade and because it'll keep me moving.

Guess we'll see what happens, huh?
