Lots of neat posts about being pagan in urban settings turned up in my feed reader during the last two weeks:

_I’ve always been in favor of urban magic, urban shamanism, urban whatever... I realize that in Kemeticism, there is no real difference between urban magic and country or nature magic._ - [Urban Kemetic](http://shezep.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/urban-kemetic/)

_In the end, urban magic isn’t so different from rural magic. The elements are still there; they’re just arranged differently._ - [Urban Magic](http://greenwoman.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/u-is-for-urban-magic-pagan-blog-project-2013/)

_This is where I work. This is where I’m home. The places where we remember that we are not separate from nature and the wild._ - [Urban Druidry](http://leithincluan.wordpress.com/2013/10/16/u-is-for-urban-druidry/)

_This snobbery regarding the city being "dead" is symptomatic of the idea that we are somehow apart from our environment._ - [Urban Paganism](http://nornoriel.dreamwidth.org/252483.html)
