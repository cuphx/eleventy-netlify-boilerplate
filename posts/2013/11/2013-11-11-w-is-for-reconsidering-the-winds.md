Air is the element I've associated with Odin in the past.

I haven't posted _Manifesting Air_ yet. Hers is a story I know fairly well but haven't spent time with in years. I'm not sure why we get away from each other.

Air was the first element that I _felt_ as an element, as energy, however you want to describe it. When I was doing the baby pagan thing, it was the first one I connected to. My tarot significator was the page of air for as long as I used tarot significators.

Somewhere along the line, though, I lost track of the Winds. I love a windy day, I can still feel the energy around me when a storm's blowing through, but it's not an element I feel like I connect to the way I do Fire and Metal. Maybe that's something else I should be working on.
