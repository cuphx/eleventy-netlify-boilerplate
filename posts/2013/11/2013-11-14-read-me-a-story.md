So I have these [divination cards](http://jackadreams.info/2012/12/08/youre-such-a-card/ "Youâ€™re Such a Card").

I made the first batch about a year ago, and I've revised them since. I think they're approaching usable for people who are not me.

To test that, I need people who are not me.

If you're interested in a reading, you can [drop me a line with contact info](http://jackadreams.info/about/contact/ "Contact") and some idea of what you'd like your reading to be about. I'm happy to do this for free in exchange for two things: your feedback on the reading itself, and possible permission for me to write about it on my blog. (No identifying details, obviously, and this is fairly negotiable.)

So if you're interested, hit me up!
