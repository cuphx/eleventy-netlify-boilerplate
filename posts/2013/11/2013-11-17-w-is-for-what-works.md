I am eclectic. That's a dirty word in a lot of circles these days, but to me the word speaks of practicality. I try to pick the simplest path, to organize and get results, whether it's with my planner or with my magic.

For that reason, I believe in what works. I've said this before, but that means I pray to the gods who answer (even the 'pop culture' ones) and I do the magic that works (even if it's a chaote's mishmash of techniques) and that which gives no results gets no attention.

This is an unpopular opinion in a magical and religious culture that seems to believe that nothing is worth having if it the process of getting it doesn't make you miserable. I don't understand this, to be honest. Why would I choose to focus on things that are hard, that require hours of my time every day, that make me unhappy and produce the same results?

I know some people want a specific thing which is difficult, and that makes sense to me. What I'm talking about is the idea that sacrifices must be painful and deitywork must be an ordeal. Sure, Odin gives me a hard time when I need it, but there are plenty of times when I want something, I fall back on an old, familiar practice or spell, and it works. There's nothing wrong with what works.
