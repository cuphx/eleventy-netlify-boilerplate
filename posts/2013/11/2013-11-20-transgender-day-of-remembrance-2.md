I don't think I can say more or better than I did for last year's [Transgender Day of Remembrance](http://jackadreams.info/2012/11/20/transgender-day-of-remembrance/). This is a subject too close to my heart for eloquence. I whisper [the names](http://www.transgenderdor.org/memorializing-2013), and I remember, and I do what I can. May the list shrink and understanding grow.
