I didn't realize the release date had passed for this book!

My story, [Words for Hera](http://jackadreams.info/2012/04/09/words-for-hera/), has been included in [Queen of Olympos: A Devotional Anthology for Hera and Iuno](http://neosalexandria.org/bibliotheca-alexandrina/current-titles/queen-of-olympos-a-devotional-anthology-for-hera-and-iuno/), which was released earlier this month in paperback and Kindle formats. Neos Alexandria puts together some very impressive devotionals, so if you're interested in the Queen of the Greek gods I highly recommend checking it out.

I originally wrote Words for Hera back in 2006 or so, at the request of my then-SO who worked with her. It was never able to be used in its original context and so it makes me very happy to finally see it appearing somewhere to properly honor the goddess who inspired it.
