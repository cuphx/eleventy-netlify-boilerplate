So two years ago today I made the first post on this blog.Â Pretty crazy, huh?

I just now got around to setting it up to crosspost to Google+ and Tumblr. Hello, Tumblr people!

I'm looking forward to next year's blogging, including posting more about the divination deck that I'm developing - it's got 52 archetypes, so it scans nicely to a post a week - as well as blogging more about fictional reconstructionism.

If you have any questions about fictional recon or any other aspect of Theos Logos, please go ahead and drop it in the comments or email me! I'd love to know if people are following along and have questions.
