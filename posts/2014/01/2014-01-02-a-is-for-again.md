As in, yes, I'm doing this again.

Repetition is hard. Building habits are hard. I have a few basic things I do [daily](http://jackadreams.info/2013/02/28/e-is-for-every-night/ "E is for EveryÂ Night") or weekly, and I'm always hesitant to interrupt them because once I find something that works for me, trying to expand it or change it is just as likely to kill it as it is to work.

So I'm still lighting candles at night, though I'm using a variety of candles, and I have to be more mindful of them because we have a cat now. I do water and incense on Sundays, but no more than that.

And so I'm doing the PBP again, because even if letter choices sometimes feel contrived, it works. Blogging has become a part of my practice, a place for me to work things out, sort through them and figure out how they fit together, and the thing that gets me to sit down with my thoughts at least once a week, no matter how busy or overwhelmed by raccoons I am, is this.

So I'm here. I'm lighting the candle. I'm offering water. I'm sitting with my thoughts. Let's see where it goes this year.
