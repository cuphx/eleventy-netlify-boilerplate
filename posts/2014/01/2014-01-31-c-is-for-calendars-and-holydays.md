Happy new year! It's going to be a busy one, as there are both Imbolc and Chinese New Year celebrations to enjoy this weekend.

I was adding another ancestor to my personal religious calendar the other day and it occurred to me that the list is getting kind of long - I've got fifteen or sixteen days on there for this year, between poetic-ancestor-heroes and Narnian saints, and that's not even getting into the New Years. It's not really overwhelming, but I wonder if it looks that way. Most of them, my offerings are simple: some relevant reading, a post on the blog, or candles and water or the like in the evening. I've never been much good for all-day or multi-day holidays where you'reÂ _working_ the whole time. I don't have the attention span for it.

What do you think makes a holiday?
