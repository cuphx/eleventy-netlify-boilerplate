The altar surface itself is one of the most overlooked parts of the pagan or magician’s altar, and yet one of the most important. Sure, you can cover almost anything with an altar cloth (and I’ll be talking about those next week) but if your altar is too small, too awkward, or badly made, it’ll bother you every time you try to work or pray. Better to invest in a good piece of furniture if you have the money and the space, and start with a solid foundation that you enjoy looking at.
