Susan nodded. "I appreciate you coming with me. I should have done this ages ago."  
  
Garcia smiled. "You needed time. Plus it's a lot harder when your ex won't talk to you."  
  
She set the pen down and looked over the spread of papers. "That's all there is to it?"Â   
  
"Well, the judge will look at it. But your ex hasn't responded, so this should finally dissolve the domestic partnership."  
  
Susan grabbed her cane and stood while Garcia gathered the paperwork. They got in line to turn it back in, and Garcia slipped her hand into Susan's free one.
