So I've been playing with the Kindle Direct Countdown option, because I like having sales, and in honor of Ash Wednesday my novel about Secret Vatican Demon Hunters trying to stop the end of the world is on sale for $.99! You can grab [Sic Transit Fidei](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EEOHRK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004EEOHRK&linkCode=as2&tag=miyu-20) over here on Amazon. (Please let me know if it's not showing up as on sale! I've never done this kind of promotion before.)

Has anyone else tried any of the Kindle Direct Publishing shinies?
