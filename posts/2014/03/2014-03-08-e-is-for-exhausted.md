As in, I am.

Two jobs, plans for Project Fishie, therapy, hobbies, religious writing, my regular practice and the illusion of a social life... I suppose maybe it's understandable that I'm tired.

Exhaustion can easily lead to letting things slide in the name of efficiency. The problem lies in not thinking about what you are choosing to drop. Some things, like religious devotion, are easy to drop without even realizing you're doing it. No matter how tired you are, it makes sense to really think about what you're letting go of and what you're holding on to.

As in anything else, the value is in the choice.
