_Fwoosh_.

Fwoosh is that moment when it all gets away from you. When the fire leaps up higher than your eyebrows. When you look up and realize you actually have no idea where you are. When the magic stops being something you're completely in control of and starts being a thing of its own accord. When you're no longer a bunch of people in a circle and instead you're a cohesive group working together.

Fwoosh is letting go, because something you build can only become greater than you if you step back and see what happens. Fwoosh is giving up control and trusting the groundwork you've laid.

Fwoosh is my favorite part of magic. It's the rush that got me addicted in the first place. I spend so much of my life overthinking, controlling, holding on for dear life. Finding that place where the story or the spell takes over and I'm just along for the ride is a work unto itself.

That's the thing about fwoosh. It's in the act of letting go that you generate the most power. It seems counter-intuitive, but I've found it to be true.
