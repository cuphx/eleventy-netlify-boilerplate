It was nice today, almost warm, so we threw open the windows and swept. Happy Ostara, if you're into that kind of thing.

Work in the second room continues. I thought I was almost done, and then the last box was full of pre-yarn, mostly sweaters waiting to be turned back into yarn. Those belong to my wife, so we'll have to decide how she feels about them in the morning; she's already in bed.

Why aren't I? I couldn't really tell you. Sometimes I just don't feel like sleeping. There are things I should be doing, like working on fiction or freelance projects, so I feel bad about just going to bed. At the same time, I'm not really able to focus on those things.

Today was the kind of day that makes me want to drive and never stop. It was beautiful.

For now, though, it's back to work.
