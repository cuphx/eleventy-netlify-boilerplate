the echo comes from the fire: find the innocent and unprotected, those who are at the mercy of the elements and human nature, and make them safer

the echo comes from the wounded: find the endangered and unprotected, those who have been at the mercy of the of men who have forgotten what it is to be human, and make them safer

the echo comes from the blood: find the marginalized and unprotected, those who are at the mercy of privilege and prejudice, and make them safer

the echo comes from the light: find the vulnerable and unprotected, those who are at the mercy of virus and exploitation, and make them safer
