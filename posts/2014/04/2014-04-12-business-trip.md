moonlight like a dropcloth over the landscape blurring the shapes and throwing deep shadows

don't look at the clock because it tells lies saying you're almost there when you'll never

arrive. here in the high desert the roads flow on, MÃ¶bius strips of tar over the scrub bushes

your foot pushes a little harder on the pedal weighed down with the distance you've driven

and the emptiness ahead, valleys of pure void with no well of light to welcome you home
