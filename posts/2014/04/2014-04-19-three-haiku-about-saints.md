_On the grounds that, baby or no baby, I don't want to come up short for this month._

green glass shards in lead painted faces, sun behind radiance refracts

flame unrecognized name unchanged but remembered orange-fingered sun

a blue veil, clean feet, a hundred thousand titles stars fading from sight
