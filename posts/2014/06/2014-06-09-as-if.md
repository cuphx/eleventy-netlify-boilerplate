spiders crawling the web-shattered screen music up too loud, black eyes daring anyone to say something, to complain, to offer to save her, and I'd swear she can see through me, x-ray vision to the spandex under my jeans.

I watch her put on makeup, flawless hands on a jerking train, the most graceful fly I've ever seen caught, tied, twisting, a trapeze artist who's far more elegant than I've ever been in the air

_as if you can save me,_ she glares. I've been caught looking, I'm the one left twisting, awkward. _as if._

she walks away from the train into the sunset-night, into the park across the street. I could follow her- I'm not the fastest, but it wouldn't be hard- but the doors close and I let her go.

as if I could save her. as if I could save anyone. _as if._
