Martian is my native tongue.  
Though I learned English  
at a young age, passed my forms,   
I still speak with an accent.  
My words are tinged with  
alien tones and people stare  
when I speak, talk over me,  
talk for me, interrupt, anything  
to interrupt my own sounds.  
  
I have been called well-spoken;  
I mistook it for a compliment   
when I was young. On Mars,  
it would have been. Martians  
speak cleanly. English words  
on a plainspoken tongue sit  
heavy, forceful, and worst, rude.  
  
Years of training cannot   
eradicate my accent. I learned  
only to stay silent, to apologize  
for my flat and honest English.  
I am losing my Martian words  
and English will never let me  
replace them. I can only keep  
my voice if I learn again  
to speak unafraid and say:  
My native language is Martian.  
You should learn it  
if you wish to understand me.
