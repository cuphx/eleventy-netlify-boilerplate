Huh. Been a while, hasn't it? I've been sick, the baby's been sick, but mostly I've been writing. Fiction, in fact. Silly stuff, with giant robots. I'm trying to have fun and remember why I love writing - why it's the center of all of my work. Like everything else, it cycles. Sometimes it comes easy and sometimes hard.

I spent the weekend moving furniture around. The house feels more like a work in progress than it has in a while, but most of it is stuff I've been planning to do. The one surprise is that I found a lovely bookshelf at a yard sale literally down the block, and Mara got a new altar. It's always a good energy boost to move things around, especially altar pieces.

Mara's altar gets place of pride in the house. It's definitely the nicest piece of furniture in the living room, and it's located in the center of the wall - it's basically the first thing your eye settles on when you come in. She gets all of the shiniest things because, well, she's Mara.Â _I'm_ not gonna tell her no.

Month one of colorwork is almost over. I am not out of the darkness yet, but Wisp stands nearby as I make my way through. I'm still waiting on a few things. And you never really know what's going to carry forward and what is going to be shed. I do have a sense of how close I am to the end of the month, though. I think Red is next - that's how it worked last time, anyway - and right around the end of the month I plan to write a wrap-up for Wisp and an introduction for Red Butler.
