Hail and well met, Catherine the White, Called Kitty, Lady of the Five Apples, She Who Wears the Bow, Sister of Mimmy, Beloved of Dear Daniel, I bid you bring your influence Into my life, your simple pleasures, Your joys and happiness. In return I offer myself As your paw in the wide world Speaking where you cannot To bring that same joy to others. Grant me the strength of heart To be kind to those who need kindness And silent when my words do no good.
