Little Cilantro is teething, so finding time to cook is hard. She doesn't like being set down and she's not napping much. Still, eaters gotta eat, so I've been looking for recipes that are fairly short preps and letting the oven do the work.

Tonight that meant bacon-wrapped pork chops. The pork chops and the bacon both came out of the freezer, where I stored them away after getting them on sale a few weeks ago.

I fried up the bacon over medium heat until it was just barely cooked, then wrapped two slices around each pork chop and placed them in one of my vintage Corningware pieces. Then they went in the oven for 35 minutes, which might have been a tad too much. I wasn't actually able to check on them because of the baby.

In fact, the baby was actively screaming when I went to pull the pork chops out, which is my excuse for what happened next.

I grabbed an oven mitt and started to pill the dish out, but my grip was not as good as I thought. The pan started to fly, and rather than lose dinner and all that hot bacon grease across the floor, I grabbed the opposite handle. The one with no oven mitt.

Yes, it hurt. When my wife got home, she found me and the baby taking advantage of the same frozen teething toy. There's a small blister right on the finger joint that's going to have an interesting time healing. Otherwise, though, I'm feeling much better now than I did.

My wife took pity on me and did the actual plating of the pork chops, baked potatoes and peas. I didn't get a picture but I'll try to remember next time.

At least the pork chops turned out good.
