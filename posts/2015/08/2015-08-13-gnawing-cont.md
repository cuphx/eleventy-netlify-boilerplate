It was going on a week before someone found me.

That ain't quite right either. Tripped over me, I reckon it went, and they dug me out under not much dirt at all. I can't hardly remember sitting up or walking back, and even when the other girls took shifts watching me over. The acolytes sat with me all patient, I couldn't tell them what had happened after it went dark.

"Mara took me," I kept telling them. "Ain't that good enough?"

"That isn't... that doesn't..." None of them had the guts to finish the damn sentence, but I knew it clear anyway. Felt like the maggots still sat inside, whispering sometimes.

"So where in the world do you think I was?" I finally snapped. "Sure and I wasn't just laying there in the trees for days." _They think you're lying,_ the maggots said. _They know your secrets. They know you're awful._

The acolytes didn't want to answer, but one of the girls in my cohort finally did. "You're not special," she spat, and the older women at least made a show of looking horrified. "You don't have to lie about getting anxious about your decision date. We all do, and we don't make up stories about it."

I surely wanted to argue with that, but I didn't have a damn word coming to me. I never have been the arguing type. Instead I just watched the acolytes shuffling all the folks back out and I didn't know what to think. I felt about as useful as a compost pile that ain't been turned.

My chest ached, and sitting there in the dark I could've swore I felt something crawling around inside. I was sure as my mama's farm that it'd been Mara took me under. She saw I was rotting inside. Course she did, she took corpses all the time.

Was it her way of keeping the rot outta her temple, or something more'n that?

There wasn't a thing keeping me there. _Not wanted, not missed,_ whispered the maggots. I packed my things. I didn't know where I was gonna go, but I wanted to be on my way afore they told me to get out.
