"How much is enough?"

"I don't know." She put another candle holder on the altar and lit another tea light. "Let's try this for now."

He nodded. "Okay. Candles. Incense. Coins. Now the petition, love."

She bowed her head, determined. "Dear Mara, I know you look over a great many people, for a great many reasons. My spouses and I, we reach out to you for your blessing. I want to carry a child, but fertility treatments are expensive and we only have enough saved for one try. Please make this possible, and I will sing your praises every day for an entire month."

He patted her back as she relaxed. "You did good."

"I hope I did good enough."

"Well, we'll see soon."
