This is the easy part, I said.

Just gather up all your random magical crap and sort it, I said.

I was wrong. I was so, so wrong.

I attempted to do the physical component of the konmari last night, gathering up everything I could find before the baby went to bed. I knew I was missing a number of things that got boxed up when we were making space for the baby, but I decided to go ahead with what I had, because as you can see above, what I had was still a pretty big pile.

One entire altar didn't even make it on the pile, I just looked at it and knew I wasn't attached to anything on it anymore. I have a box of things that are definitely no longer mine. But this was so much harder than I expected.

There's a surprising amount of anxiety in dismantling an altar or taking down a figure I no longer have any connection with. It's not as if it's necessarily long term, and it's explicitly not a reflection of my relationship with the god but somehow I have no active Kuan Yin altar and that bothers me.

I have _five_ sets of runes, somehow. I couldn't even find one of them. Two sets are handmade by me. Two other sets are handmade ones I bought. I read with runes approximately three times a _year,_ I don't need this many rune, Allfather or no Allfather. But I'm supposed to do this without thinking of the practice of reading runes, right? How the hell do I separate the tool from the thing the tool does? For some reason I thought this would be a lot easier than it is to separate.

I got overwhelmed and also took much longer than I'd envisioned. I'm going to have to try this again when I have more spare brain, I think. Maybe this weekend, when I can stay up a little later, and when I have time to go hunting for missing pieces.
