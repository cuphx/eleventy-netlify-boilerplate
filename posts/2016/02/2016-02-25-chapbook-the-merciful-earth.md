[The Merciful Earth](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C6U06TG), a chapbook collection of some of the fiction, prayers and poems I've written for Mara, is now available on Amazon for $.99! This is the fulfillment of a promise I made to her three and a half years ago in exchange for her help with a major project my wife and I were working on. She has been a very kind and patient Lady while I got my head together.
