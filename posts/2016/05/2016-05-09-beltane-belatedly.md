In my post about Walpurgisnacht, I talked about accepting my emptiness. I have been mulling the idea of seeing myself as full of something, even if that something is nothingness. I have identified myself with shadows and voids before in my life, and as goth as it sounds, that association is still a comfortable one for me.

The day after, my family got up and went to church at the UU, where a friend from local druid and pagan groups was in charge of a service celebrating Beltane and discussing the important of embodiment. Despite years of dance and martial arts classes, I've never quite felt at home in my body. Dissociation and body dysphoria are both recurring issues, and while I've made progress with everything from shape-shifting meditation to strength training to hormone therapy and surgery, there are still plenty of bad days to go around.

Embodiment is shadow work for me. I can sit with my darkness far more easily than I can sit still in my skin. Jung talks about being stuck in a stage of melancholia when the shadow is brought forth to engage with the ego, and compares this to the alchemical stage of _nigredo_ or __tenebrositas.__ I wonder if the process of transitioning is bound up in this psychological process?

I've certainly felt rather stuck in a year-long dark night of the soul. I get the feeling that internal work overlaps with what Hekate wants to see from me. After all, Jung _also_ talked about the _nekiya_ and _katabasis,_ descents into the underworld, and while he meant it metaphorically, Hekate _did_ nudge me toward Persephone and thence Hades.

I'm still a little boggled by the whole Greek... thing? I guess? One Greek deity was one thing, but I'm getting dangerously close to this being a whole _thing_ and I'm trying to make it clear that I'm not interested in doing a recon route and am not comfortable touching the idea of miasma with a twenty foot pole due to my OCD issues. Hopefully that's acceptable; if it's not, I'm willing to opt out, because I don't want to play chicken with scrupulosity.

And while it feels a bit odd to be doing shadow work as the summer comes on, well, the brightest light casts the darkest shadows, and my shadow work is a bit inside-out anyway.
