The most intimidating part of this remains having to find something to say everyday about what I'm doing. I'm anxious about doing this, and about doing it publicly. I already committed though, so I might as well.

To start with, here is the short daily prayer I wrote for Mara:

_Good Earth, be with us_ _Mother Market, be with us_ _Lady Luck, be with us_ _Hearthtender, be with us_ _Bread-raiser, be with us_ _Mother of Rot, be with us_ _Bountiful Harvest, be with us_

It's a set of seven because she always prods me towards sevens or multiples when I'm working on things like prayer beads. Wednesday is tentatively for Ganesh and Bluebird, so we'll see how the first day of this goes in the morning.

Meanwhile, [this post from Circle Thrice](http://www.circlethrice.com/2017/02/sustain-ability-home-economics.html) turned out quite timely. Using the household as a focus seems so obvious, and yet I realize in a lot of ways I was overlooking it. While we have a kitchen shrine and offerings for the wights, a _lot_ of my wards at the old place were physical, and it showed when we moved. I still have physical wards planned that I haven't put up yet, and I'll hopefully be doing that this month, too.

I started a couple of seeds in the house this week. Nothing much, just a cucumber and a tomato plant, but I wanted to start _something_. I bought strawberry seeds to start with the kid, too. So far she's only focused on getting strawberry pancakes at the end but it's a beginning.
