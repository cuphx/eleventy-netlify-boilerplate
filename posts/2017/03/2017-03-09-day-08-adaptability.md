Well that after-work thing worked well for two whole days, and then tonight we were determined to _not_ just miss out on _another_ couch, so my spouse picked me up and we went a-couching. It's a good deal and in nice shape and they're going to see about delivering it, so if it works out it'll be worth it.

That meant that I was doing ritual after bedtime again, with minimal intonations. Pillai and Bluebird are up again, as I start the second week of doing this. I ended up going off-script today, but that's okay. I like the idea of the prayers as something when I don't know what to say, but if I want to add something in, I'm not going to ignore it.

I actually found myself looking forward to it - waiting for the chance to turn to the powers for a few minutes is a good feeling. Even when the hair level means I should keep an eye on them.

(Edit: I published this right before going to bed last night and I have no idea what that last sentence was supposed to be.)
