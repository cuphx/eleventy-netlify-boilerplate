Went straight from work to couch-shopping again, so I didn't get to repeat what I did yesterday. We actually successfully acquired a couch, so that took up most of the evening. 

I ended up deciding to go outside anyway as my spouse was getting the baby called down - turns out its a good way to be able to concentrate without having to wait until the Littlest  Insomniac was actually asleep. 

It was a good night, dry and reasonably warm with a view of of the moon. I have a finalized version of Brhenti's prayer on Instagram. 

Then I had to go right to toddler management, so I didn't get to post until later, but in the long run, as long as I can find time to do the thing, I think.
