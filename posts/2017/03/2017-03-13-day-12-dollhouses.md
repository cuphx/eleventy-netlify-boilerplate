Redbird, on the other hand, is chatty.

She was there when I went to bed late last night, and when I went to teach my kids at church this morning, and when I was enjoying the gorgeous, warm, clear afternoon, and when I went down to the creek (after dark, but the sun is still there even when it's dark).

Redbird also nudged me to work on something I'd been thinking around but not quite getting to for a while. One of my ongoing projects is a "doll house" with representations of the powers I work with, where I can leave symbolic offerings that I periodically renew with energy, and with a floor that represents the household/our space that can be used for sympathetic magic in warding our space.

It's going to be a long-term project. I have a fairly good kit of accessories and offerings at this point, and I've finally settled on which dolls are in which roles, but very little doll fashion is designed for deity representation, so I've got a lot of sewing to do. Or to commission. Or both.

But the important partÂ is this tangible thing took a step forward today and I'm a step closer to the final product.
