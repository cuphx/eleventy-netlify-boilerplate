Another lesson in finding the places and times that are right. _I come before you on your day in this sacred place._ 

After work I went to the library. I needed to return a book. But once I was there it occurred to me that I could offer my prayers and energy there too. I include the library wights in my offerings already, after all, and libraries are very much [sacred places](https://jackofmanytrades.info/2013/07/06/the-library/). Pillai is sometimes associated with knowledge, too. 

Little Insomniac kept me up quite late so I'm going to leave this there.
