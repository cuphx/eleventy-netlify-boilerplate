Tzymir remains quiet. I'm having a hard time picturing myself having an ongoing relationship with him, which is frustrating. I'm not sure if I need to step back or just try to relax about it or what.

Probably relax about it. Usually I need to relax about things.

Today was mostly errand running and starting to re-organize my jewelry stuff. I got some new offerings into the dollhouse and some more fiber for felting. I need to get some more work done on the Redbird doll; I picked up some wool with a different texture today that I think might work well as hair on her.

Not much else to talk about; some days are just the weight of habit and that has to be okay or I'll never actually build the daily practice back up again.
