Not quite, though I've been trying to be more mindful about my social media and computer usage in general. April is for poetry, so I've been poeming.

Most of my poetry so far has been related to one of my fiction projects and posted on Dreamwidth as [a collection](https://rainbowfic.dreamwidth.org/1389190.html) and [a second, longer piece](https://rainbowfic.dreamwidth.org/1389916.html). I also wrote [a sonnet about lunch](http://secondhandpagan.tumblr.com/post/159519392070/lunch).

I also published [A Home Made of Bells](http://paganbloggers.com/octobercountry/blog/2017/04/11/a-home-made-of-bells/) over at October Country.
