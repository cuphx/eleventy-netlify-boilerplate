who are you without your identity? lay down, settle in your bones let your self release above you, a balloon you are disconnected from. you are your body, too, what is left when your soul leaves. feel your body breathing, digesting, slowing, churning, falling apart an inch at a time. she keeps us alive, feeding us, but in the Winter she will bleed us and cut us down and leave us to others who seek sustenance. she is not concerned with what comes after aside from decomposition. we break down with our component parts. we go on to become part of others' cycles.
