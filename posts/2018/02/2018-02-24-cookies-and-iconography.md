I was thinking about girl scouting, because it's cookie season.

When I was a kid my mom was a troop leader (and a sunday school teacher, and basically she was always willing to take over something I was doing that otherwise wouldn't happen, and that's a part of her parenting that I do want to bring into my own parenting) and so a couple times a year we'd go down to council headquaters to pick up some paperwork or something and we'd pop into the little store there that sold uniforms and books and...

_and badges and pins_

At the time I remember being fascinated by the idea that I could theoretically buy ANY BADGE I WANTED regardless of whether or not I'd done the work for it, and nobody would stop me (except, in theory, my mom, I guess?). There were no checks or balances! I could just buy them!

I didn't. But I _could have_.

And that's the story of why I now have a big mason jar full of badges from my old girl scout days and from estate sales and trading them with other people and also I have a bunch of girl scout pins on my coat and I use them in magic spells because they have built in iconography. They have a consistent look. There's an aesthetic that says "I'm part of something" and implies work put in to owning that badge, whether it's a badge I earned myself or a badge another scout earned years ago and I bought at an estate sale.

There's a story behind a scout badge, just like there is behind a lot of secondhand things, but the badge makes it a little more obvious, a little easier to harness that story into spellwork.

I miss blogging here more often and I'm wondering if anybody has some good prompts to recommend, either the kind that come as a list or the kind that get posted weekly. If you've got suggestions, let me know!
