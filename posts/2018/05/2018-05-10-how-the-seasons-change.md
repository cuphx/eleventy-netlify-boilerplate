Sunday was First Market, and a beautiful day for it too, warm and clear. We took Bug and a kid who just moved in that she's made friends with, and took them to the park after, and came home with fresh asparagus and bagels, mushrooms and jam, and books from the library booth and half-eaten muffins.

Today I spent my lunch hour outside, nursing a glass of iced tea. The goslings down the street are starting to stretch out.

This is how I mark the seasons. I may be terrible at gardening, but even I can see the shift if I'm looking.
